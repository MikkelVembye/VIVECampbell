# Read an RIS file into a data frame

Parses an RIS file into a data.frame, preserving the order of tags as
they first appear in the file. Repeated tags within a record are
collapsed into a single semicolon-separated string.

## Usage

``` r
read_ris_to_dataframe(file_path)
```

## Arguments

- file_path:

  character. Path to the RIS file to read.

## Value

A data.frame with one row per record and one column per encountered RIS
tag (e.g., TY, AU, TI). Columns are ordered by first appearance of the
tag in the file. Repeated tag values are collapsed with "; ".

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
df <- read_ris_to_dataframe("data-raw/raw data/apa_psycinfo_test_data.ris")
} # }
```
