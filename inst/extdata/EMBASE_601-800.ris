N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this cross-sectional, descriptive study was to characterize the impact of modifiable activities on older adult mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and to understand the interaction between older adult behaviors and the mental health of their informal caregivers. METHOD(S): This study leveraged the National Health and Aging Trends Study and associated Family and Friends survey completed 2020-2021. Participants included 3,257 community dwelling older adults and 2,062 associated unpaid caregivers, weighted sample sizes 26,074,143 and 21,871,408, respectively. RESULT(S): Older adult engagement in volunteering, religious, or group activities was associated with decreased older adult depression, as was increased walking or vigorous activity. However, online compared to in-person participation correlated with greater loneliness in older adults and anxiety for their caregivers. Finally, increased appreciation by the care recipient correlated with decreased caregiver depression. CONCLUSION(S): Overall, a close interaction exists between caregiver and older adult behavior and psychiatric symptoms. Online activities are not an equivalent substitute for in-person activities during required social isolation; however, they remain superior to no participation. Further, increased walking and caregiver appreciation may ameliorate some of the harms of isolation. Health care providers should continue to promote engagement, exercise, and appreciation as ways to improve older adult and informal caregiver mental health.

N2  - Background: Latino families are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes (T2D) and lifestyle intervention is the first-line approach for preventing T2D. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a culturally-grounded lifestyle intervention that prioritizes health promotion and diabetes prevention for Latino families. The intervention is guided by a novel Family Diabetes Prevention Model, leveraging the family processes of engagement, empowerment, resilience, and cohesion to orient the family system towards health. Method(s): Latino families (N = 132) will be recruited and assessed for glucose tolerance as measured by an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and General and Weight-Specific Quality of Life (QoL) at baseline, four months, and 12 months. All members of the household age 10 and over will be invited to participate. Families will be randomized to the intervention group or a control group (2:1). The 16-week intervention includes weekly nutrition and wellness classes delivered by bilingual, bicultural Registered Dietitians and community health educators at a local YMCA along with two days/week of supervised physical activity classes and a third day of unsupervised physical activity. Control families will meet with a physician and a Registered Dietitian to discuss the results of their metabolic testing and recommend lifestyle changes. We will test the efficacy of a family-focused diabetes prevention intervention for improving glucose tolerance and increasing QoL and test for mediators and moderators of long-term changes. Conclusion(s): This study will provide much needed data on the efficacy of a family-focused Diabetes Prevention Program among high-risk Latino families.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Objective: More than a million female village-level lay providers called 'Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs)', who deliver primary care, face high levels of stress due to work demands and low compensation, within the context of poverty and gender inequality. Evidence on ASHAs has focused on workplace challenges from a system perspective, without sufficient probing into individual-level stress. This study aims to gain perspectives into the experiences of work stress, the related health symptoms, and the responses to stress among ASHAs in India. Method(s): Focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted with ASHAs in Sehore district, Madhya Pradesh, were audio-recorded and transcribed. Grounded theory was used to generate themes under the various domains of ASHAs' work and domestic life. We identified pathways between the conditions that trigger stressful events, experiences of these events, resulting perceptions, effects on health and wellbeing, and approaches used by ASHAs to respond to stress. Result(s): Six FGDs with 59 ASHAs generated the following themes: (a) Facility: Workload, undue pressures, unstructured work; ASHAs' relationships with seniors (e.g., feelings of being disrespected, blamed, or targeted), and low access to physical and administrative resources; (b) Home: Feelings of guilt for putting less time for family/child care; disrespect by the elderly for a poorly incentivised job; (c) Community: Low acceptance by the villagers; caste- and gender-bias; difficult community-level relationships (emotional labour, fear/stigma towards her services); (d) Somatic and psychological symptoms: headache, exhaustion, depressive symptoms (to cite a few); and (e) Responses to stress: Motivation (support from peers, family, a sense of identity/pride, incentives), Individual strengths (e.g., social responsibility), and spiritual recourse mechanisms. Conclusion(s): This study will inform the development of a strengths-based coaching intervention to address work stress among ASHAs. The findings are relevant to building the evidence on alleviation of work stress among female frontline cadres in low-resource settings globally.Copyright © 2023 The Authors

N2  - Background: Community members in Quibdo (Choco, Colombia) are highly vulnerable to psychosocial problems associated with the internal armed conflict, poverty, and insufficient public services, and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. A pilot study was conducted with conflict-affected adults in Quibdo to assess feasibility and outcomes of a community-based psychosocial support group intervention using three different intervention modalities: in-person, remote (conducted online), and hybrid (half of sessions in-person, half-remote). This group model integrated problem-solving and culturally based expressive activities and was facilitated by local community members with supervision by mental health professionals. Method(s): This study utilized a mixed-explanatory sequential design (a quantitative phase deriving in a qualitative phase) with 39 participants and 8 staff members. Participants completed quantitative interviews before and after an eight-week group intervention. A subset of 17 participants also completed in-depth qualitative interviews and a focus group discussion was conducted with staff at post-intervention. Result(s): From pre- to post-intervention, participants in all modalities demonstrated improved wellbeing and reduced symptoms of generalized distress, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. Use of coping skills varied across modalities, with remote groups associated with a decrease in some forms of coping, including use of social support. In qualitative interviews and the focus group discussion, participants and staff described logistical challenges and successes, as well as facilitators of change such as problem resolution, emotional regulation and social support with variations across modalities, such that remote groups provided fewer opportunities for social support and cohesion. Conclusion(s): Results offer preliminary evidence that this model can address psychosocial difficulties across the three modalities, while also identifying potential risks and challenges, therefore providing useful guidance for service delivery in conflict-affected settings during the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenging contexts. Implications of this study for subsequent implementation of a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) are discussed.Copyright © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Objective To investigate the post- traumatic growth status of patients with benign central airway stenosis undergoing interventional therapy, and analyze the influencing factors, so as to provide basis for the formulation of measures to improve the treatment tolerance and quality of life of patients. Methods Patients with benign central airway stenosis treated by interventional therapy in the First Affiliated Hospital of Second Military Medical University from May 2020 to May 2022 were selected by convenient sampling. The general information questionnaire, Chinese Version of Post-traumatic Growth Inventory, Perceived Social Support Scale and Chronic Disease Patients' Health Literacy Management Scale were used to conduct a cross-sectional survey. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyze the influencing factors of patients' posttraumatic growth. Results A total of 183 questionnaires were distributed, and 172 questionnaires were effectively collected, with an effective recovery rate of 93.99% (172/183). The posttraumatic growth score of 172 patients was (62.66 +/- 9.54) points; Pearson correlation analysis showed that perceived social support, health literacy and post- traumatic growth were positively correlated (r=0.483, 0.246, both P0.05). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the degree of stenosis, the number of interventional therapy, social support, and health literacy were the main influencing factors for the post-traumatic growth of patients with benign central airway stenosis undergoing interventional therapy (t values were -3.46-4.55, all P0.05), could jointly explain 38.9% of the variation in post-traumatic growth scores. Conclusions The post-traumatic growth of patients with benign airway stenosis undergoing interventional therapy is at a moderate level. The degree of stenosis and the number of interventional therapy are the limiting factors for post- traumatic growth. Systematic health education, social support and health literacy are conducive to more post-traumatic growth of patients. Medical staff can enhance patients' disease awareness, and provide more channels for acquiring disease knowledge through WeChat groups and WeChat official account, so as to promote patients' post-traumatic growth and reduce their painful experience during treatment.Copyright © 2023 Chinese Journal of Practical Nursing.

N2  - The healthcare system in Nepal faces challenges despite the establishment of numerous medical colleges and an increasing number of doctors. The distribution of medical colleges is disproportionately concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural populations without quality health care. The mental well-being of physicians is a growing concern, with studies indicating high levels of burnout, stress, and depression among healthcare workers, worsened by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Rising suicide rates among medical professionals highlight the severity of burnout and depression in the healthcare sector. Factors contributing to this crisis include inadequate recruitment in government hospitals, a shortage of healthcare professionals, and inefficiencies in resource distribution. Attacks on physicians have become alarmingly frequent, necessitating comprehensive studies to understand the challenges faced by different specialties and the impact of rural versus urban settings. To address these issues, prompt filling of vacant positions in government hospitals and prioritizing physicians' mental health is crucial. The government should offer competitive salaries, effective management, and supportive working environments to combat the brain drain. Initiatives inspiring professionals to stay in Nepal, along with maintaining the National Health Insurance Program and controlling healthcare privatization, are necessary. Resilience training, professional programs, and improved infrastructure in government medical colleges are vital. This crisis demands global attention and a national study to evaluate burnout, depression, and suicide among healthcare professionals. By addressing these challenges and supporting the well-being of healthcare workers, Nepal can work toward a sustainable healthcare system that provides quality care for all.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Burnout is an occupational phenomenon caused by ineffectively managed work-related stress. Burnout is common among healthcare professionals and has the capacity to compromise patient care, but is not well characterised in pharmacists. Aim(s): This systematic review aimed to establish the prevalence of burnout among pharmacists, and its associated risk factors. Method(s): A systematic search of Embase, PubMed, CINAHL and PsychInfo was carried out. Studies were included using the following eligibility criteria; original research investigating burnout prevalence in pharmacists in patient-facing roles in any jurisdiction, using any validated burnout measurement instrument. No language or date barriers were set. Data were extracted by the first author and accuracy checked by co-authors. A pooled prevalence was estimated, and narrative synthesis provided. Result(s): Burnout prevalence data were extracted from 19 articles involving 11,306 pharmacist participants across eight countries. More than half (51%) of pharmacists were experiencing burnout. Associated risk factors included longer working hours, less professional experience, high patient and prescription volumes, excessive workload and poor work/life balance. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted pharmacist burnout and resilience. Involvement in education and training and access to burnout management resources were associated with lower rates of burnout, but burnout intervention effectiveness is unknown. Conclusion(s): Burnout remains high among pharmacists and may negatively affect the quality of patient care. There is significant heterogeneity pertaining to the definition and assessment of burnout and there remains a need to identify and evaluate effective individual and organisational burnout interventions.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - AIM: This study aimed to investigate the effects of problem-solving skills development training for nursing students on their levels of resilience, perceived stress, and self-efficacy. BACKGROUND: Although there are many studies on the problem-solving skills of nursing students, few have been based on the social problem-solving model. Most are cross-sectional and descriptive studies. Surprisingly, the number of studies that examine the effects of training for problem solving in nursing students is also quite limited. DESIGN: This was a single-blind, randomised controlled trial. METHOD(S): The study was conducted at the department of nursing of a state university in Western Turkey. Seventy-two second-year nursing students initially participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 19.97 +/- 1.39 years. Of the participants, 72.2% were women, and 70.8% did not consider themselves academically successful. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. The experimental group received problem-solving skills development training based on the Social Problem-Solving Model once a week in a total of seven weeks (eight sessions), in which two sessions were in the last week. Duration of each session took at least 55 min and 150 min at max. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire that included a personal information form, Resilience Scale for Nurses, Social Problem Solving-Inventory-Short Form, Perceived Stress Scale, and General Self-Efficacy Scale. Measurements were performed at three different times: at the beginning of the study (T0), immediately after the training provided to the experimental group (T1), and one month follow-up measurement after the intervention (T2). Repeated-measures analysis of variance and covariance were performed to analyse data. RESULT(S): The mean post-training and 1-month follow-up scores for problem-solving, resilience, and self-efficacy of the students in the experimental group (the mean of T1 and T2 scores) were significantly higher, and the mean post-training and 1-month follow-up perceived stress scores of the students in the experimental group was significantly lower than those of the control group. CONCLUSION(S): This study concluded that problem-solving skills training based on a social problem-solving model provided to nursing students increased their social problem solving, resilience, and self-efficacy levels and reduced their perceived stress. Therefore, further studies that plan intervention and training programs aimed at improving the social problem-solving levels of nursing students and include social problem-solving courses in university curricula are recommended.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background The Health Brain Initiative (HBI), established by University of Miami's Comprehensive Center for Brain Health (CCBH), follows racially/ethnically diverse older adults without dementia living in South Florida. With dementia prevention and brain health promotion as an overarching goal, HBI will advance scientific knowledge by developing novel assessments and noninvasive biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), examining additive effects of sociodemographic, lifestyle, neurological and biobehavioral measures, and employing innovative, methodologically advanced modeling methods to characterize ADRD risk and resilience factors and transition of brain aging. Methods HBI is a longitudinal, observational cohort study that will follow 500 deeply-phenotyped participants annually to collect, analyze, and store clinical, cognitive, behavioral, functional, genetic, and neuroimaging data and biospecimens. Participants are >50 years old; have no, subjective, or mild cognitive impairment; have a study partner; and are eligible to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recruitment is community-based including advertisements, word-of-mouth, community events, and physician referrals. At baseline, following informed consent, participants complete detailed web-based surveys (e.g., demographics, health history, risk and resilience factors), followed by two half-day visits which include neurological exams, cognitive and functional assessments, an overnight sleep study, and biospecimen collection. Structural and functional MRI is completed by all participants and a subset also consent to amyloid PET imaging. Annual follow-up visits repeat the same data and biospecimen collection as baseline, except that MRIs are conducted every other year after baseline. Ethics and expected impact HBI has been approved by the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Participants provide informed consent at baseline and are re-consented as needed with protocol changes. Data collected by HBI will lead to breakthroughs in developing new diagnostics and therapeutics, creating comprehensive diagnostic evaluations, and providing the evidence base for precision medicine approaches to dementia prevention with individualized treatment plans.Copyright: © 2023 Besser et al.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence of nonpharmacological intervention for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is lacking. AIMS: To examine whether an 8-week nurse-led cognitive-behavioral based group intervention would enhance resilient coping and life quality among community-based patients with TRD. METHOD(S): The participants were randomly sampled from a cohort of TRD recruited from two general teaching hospitals. The two groups were assessed with multiple outcome measures at baseline (T0); 8-week post-baseline (T1); and at 3, 6, and 9 months after T1 (T2-4). Psychoeducation was nested in the cognitive behavioral group intervention to facilitate discussion. RESULT(S): Of the 23 participants (mean age 56 years, 69.6% female) in the experimental group, higher resilient coping and lower mental distress levels at T1 as well as later improved quality of life and community integration at T2-4 were observed compared to the controls across COVID-19 (T3). Overall, the scores of resilience and community integration were higher throughout the four follow-up points of observations for the experimental group. CONCLUSION(S): The findings indicated that an 8-week nurse-led cognitive-behavioral based group intervention may enhance the TRD patients' resilient coping and mental distress levels while providing the potentials for community reintegration after mental health psychoeducation engagement. It is imperative for the nurses caring for patients with TRD to extend from clinical-based intervention to community-based self-care approach, with the importance of short-term stress management and healthy lifestyle development highlighted during the community reintegration trajectory.

N2  - PURPOSE: Professional coaching has been utilized in the military and private sector with a long track record of optimizing efficiency, improving high-functioning team performance, and creating greater satisfaction among the workforce. Recent studies in physician populations have suggested that coaching may protect healthcare providers from burnout and improve quality of life and resilience. The aims of the current study were to describe our single-institution experience with the introduction of a leadership coaching program among surgical residents and to characterize the nature of the common reasons for referral for coaching. METHOD(S): Upon identification by program faculty that a resident would benefit from coaching, an email was sent from the program director to the coach to establish contact between the coach and resident, with a brief synopsis of the factors that lead to the resident being referred for coaching. The study team obtained deidentified, simplified synopses of the initial email correspondences from program leadership reaching out to residents to refer them to coaching. Common recurring themes were quantified. Later, coaches reviewed their notes kept during coaching sessions and, in a similar fashion, identified topics discussed and skills developed in coaching sessions for each resident. Topics were summarized for each resident, and a deidentified list of residents and the themes reviewed in coaching were provided to the study team, who quantified these topics. Baseline demographic information on the resident cohort, including training level, gender, and number of repeat referrals were summarized to delineate differences in patterns of repeat referral and attrition. RESULT(S): This study was conducted within the general surgery residency program at a single academic medical center, composed of 43 categorical and 8 preliminary residents. Over a 2.5-year period, 21 residents were referred: 5 chief, 8 senior, 5 midlevel, and 3 junior (1 preliminary) residents. Male residents represented 2/3 and female residents 1/3 of the total number of referrals. There were 3 repeat referrals, 2 male and 1 female. We identified 2 overarching reasons for which residents were referred for coaching: request for structured leadership training and request for communication training. Six themes were identified upon review of referrals for coaching. Among these were the need for improved communication, methods to improve team integration, tools to balance professional and personal responsibilities, and practices to improve confidence and assertiveness. Through the coaching relationship, residents reviewed deficits and received an individualized plan to address newly identified problem areas. Upon initiation of coaching, new themes like anxiety management, emotional intelligence, and cultural acclimatization were identified. During each coaching session, residents participate in exercises designed to build habits of effective listening, communication, and conflict resolution. CONCLUSION(S): Coaching in surgical residency provides a structured program for residents to develop skills in planning and orchestrating team operations, listening and communicating effectively, mitigating conflict, and managing professional and personal responsibilities. Follow-up studies will focus on the long-term effects of professional coaching, evaluating survey data from self-assessments and professional evaluations.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Background: Improving the quality of care for a diverse population requires a diverse healthcare workforce which necessitates high educational attainment among underrepresented communities. Programs aimed to address healthcare workforce diversity gaps also serve as a public health intervention by offering avenues to improve the health of local communities by providing students with the knowledge and skills to promote healthy behaviors, foster scientific literacy, and inspire future public health professionals - who in turn serve their local communities to advance health outcomes. We interviewed alumni of the New York Presbyterian Hospital Lang Youth Medical Program (LYMP), a high school health sciences mentoring and enrichment program for underrepresented minority youth in Upper Manhattan, from graduating classes between 2012 and 2021 to explore their perspectives on what aspects of the program had the most impact on their academic and career paths. Method(s): This is a qualitative study using in-depth, semi-structured individual interviews. All interviews were analyzed using the constant comparative method for developing grounded theory, following a convenience sampling method. Result(s): 106 codes were organized into 24 themes, which were further arranged into 4 topic areas: demonstrated program success, intangible program drivers, improvement opportunities, and barriers to program participation. Topic areas captured participants' perspectives on how the program is designed to foster an environment of personal, academic, and professional development; ways aspects of the program organically worked together to provide unanticipated positive facilitators; opportunities for program improvements, and external factors that influenced decision-making. Conclusion(s): Through this study, we found that the LYMP had a positive influence in helping participants set and achieve personal, academic, and professional goals. Alumni reported activities and experiences offered by the program that foster key youth development constructs linked to healthier and more resilient communities. Importantly, the vast majority of participants described how the synergism between program features, staff support, family involvement, and professional development and networking created an environment of achievement that went beyond the scope of the program design. Findings from this study offer a blueprint for other organizations to craft a similarly successful enrichment program that improves health outcomes, reduces health disparities, and promotes overall population health.Copyright © 2023 Kohut, Wang, Sanchez, Rausch, Nieto and Minguez.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate experiences and reflections on challenges in everyday life of people living with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) and chronic pain in order to improve rehabilitation services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The design for this study was qualitative using the Interpretive Description methodology and the salutogenic theory of Sense of Coherence as the theoretical framework. Four semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with 19 adults with LGMD from April to May 2021. The interviews were conducted online due to COVID-19. RESULT(S): Living with chronic pain and LGMD affected everyday life in terms of the participants' overall Sense of Coherence. Beneficial or unfavorable coping strategies were identified within four interrelated categorical themes: pain management, normality comprehension, affected emotional sentiment and altered identity. CONCLUSION(S): Healthcare professionals should acknowledge possible chronic pain secondary to LGMD. Chronic pain appears to be a prevalent problem in people with LGMD with negative impact on everyday life, yet patients with LGMD did not receive sufficient information and necessary tools from health professionals to cope with chronic pain. Thus, adequate pain management appeared to be a difficult and self-taught process. Educating health professionals on how to support patients with LGMD and chronic pain is needed.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONHealth professionals should acknowledge and address the possibility of chronic pain secondary to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) and educate patients in pain management.Physiotherapy, energy management and engagement in meaningful activities may help patients gain some control of pain and limit the consequences of pain on everyday life.Supporting patients to accept pain and to shift focus towards their current capabilities may potentially improve pain management.Educating health professionals on how to support patients with LGMD and chronic pain is needed.

N2  - Objectives: The association between exposure to trauma and the development of psychopathology has been shown, but data have not often included large sample sizes followed longitudinally. Additionally, the impact of resiliency on the development and course of mental illness could direct clinical assessment following trauma. Method(s): The Childhood Trauma Research Network (CTRN) is an initiative funded by the Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium (TCMHCC) to conduct health services research in high-impact areas related to child mental health. It is coordinated through a network of 12 health-related institutions (HRIs) in Texas that serve as nodes. Each of the HRIs aid in recruitment of participants who are followed for a 2-year period (N = 1411). Participants are interviewed at baseline and then at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The data included in this study are at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months. Each includes self-assessments by parents and child as well as clinician-administered. Formal assessment is obtained through scales including the Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A) for depression, Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Children and Adolescents for DSM-5 (CAPS-CA-5) for PTSD, and the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders-C (SCARED-C) for anxiety. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10) is utilized as a measure of resiliency. Result(s): Older age at time of initial assessment and trauma load were associated with higher scores on CAPS-CA-5 (p <.049 for age and p <.0054 for trauma load). Individuals currently receiving treatment with therapy or medications had higher PTSD scores (p <.012 for therapy and p <.045 for medication). Male gender is associated with lower PTSD scores (p <.00013). Higher resiliency scores are associated with lower future depression (p < 2.05E-149). Conclusion(s): In this large-scale research network, high resiliency scores are associated with a lower degree of future depressive symptoms, but they do not directly correlate with PTSD diagnosis or symptoms severity. Resiliency appears to be more predictive for depression than PTSD. Individuals identified as male are more likely to score high on the resiliency scale and are less likely to meet criteria for PTSD or generalized anxiety disorder. Treatment with medication and/or therapy is associated with higher degree of symptom severity, and those with greater symptom severity are more likely to have received treatment. Those with higher baseline PTSD scores saw the greatest improvement over a time period of 6 months. TRA, PTSD, MCSCopyright © 2023

T1  - 5.4 External Maternal Roles in South Asian Families and Cultures
T3  - The Scientific Proceedings of the 70th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. New York United States.

N2  - Objectives: This presentation aims to examine cultural dynamics affecting child development through extended maternal figures in South Asian culture. In addition, it will evaluate cultural impact, beliefs, and practices on child-extended maternal figure relationships, and examine their implications on child and adolescent psychiatry and mental health. Also, this presentation will highlight the importance of culturally sensitive approaches in assessment and treatment, and facilitate discussion and best practices to promote positive social-emotional development and resilience in children through extended maternal figures in South Asian culture. Method(s): Afifa Adiba, MD, is an early-career psychiatrist originally from Bangladesh, currently practicing at the Sheppard Pratt as a Service Chief for the Adolescent Mood Disorder Unit. Her research focuses on the acculturation process with a particular emphasis on the South Asian community. Dr. Adiba is a proud mother of a 2-year-old Asian American daughter, providing her with a unique perspective and lived experience. She will offer insights and perspectives based on her personal and professional experiences, while also providing a discussion of evidence-based practices in working with families. Focus will be on understanding the impact of South Asian culture on the relationship between extended maternal figures and children, and how this dynamic can inform the practice of child and adolescent psychiatry. Result(s): Attendees will have a deeper understanding of matriarchal roles in South Asian cultures and the importance of cultural sensitivity in clinical practice. Participants will also learn how to involve extended maternal figures respectfully and objectively, facilitate communication, and address instances in which a mother may feel neglected. As healthcare providers, it is important to approach these situations with an unbiased perspective and make decisions that are in the best interest of the child and family. Conclusion(s): The presence of extended maternal figures in South Asian child rearing is a common dynamic, particularly when the mother is employed. These maternal figures can provide both benefits and challenges in child rearing and decision making. As child and adolescent psychiatrists, it is important to understand the cultural dynamics at play to provide the best guidance and care for families. Cultural sensitivity in clinical care helps children grow emotionally and socially, and supports families in raising well-rounded kids. CUL, FAM, SREGCopyright © 2023

T1  - 60.1 Creating a Safe Space for Ukrainian Refugee Children
T3  - The Scientific Proceedings of the 70th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. New York United States.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Objectives: More than 7 million people, mainly women with children, fled Ukraine for Poland consequent to Russia's February 2022 invasion. As a previously established organization (World Association for Positive and Transcultural Psychotherapy [WAPP]) of mental health practitioners (MHPs), we created the World Association for Positive and Transcultural Psychotherapy Support Project (WAPPSP) for colleagues touched by war conditions. Polish legislation registered WAPPSPA (an Association) as a nongovernmental organization operating in emergency support situations. This presentation aims to convey information about a mental health program, employing a very wide range of inputs, established for Ukrainian refugee children in a Polish city (Leszno). In addition, this presentation will highlight the work of uniting MHPs from different countries in order to support colleagues touched by war, via sharing and exchanging international experience and knowledge of intervention approaches and establishing programs focused on strengthening the resilience of children, families, and adults affected by war. Method(s): The methods employed include: a mental health support program for child refugees (Ukrainian House); training and education for specialists via individual and group supervision and conferences; psychosocial support for Ukrainian MHPs; cross-professional and cross-border collaborations; and enhanced public awareness of the impact of war-related violence. Result(s): WAPPSPA established: 1) a mental health support program for over 4000 Ukrainian children and adolescents in Leszno; 2) online (600 participants) and on-site (70 participants) trainings, lectures, and group discussions focusing on self-care, stabilization, and trauma therapy for children and adolescents; 3) an international conference in Leszno (431 participants); and 4) social support for over 50 Ukrainian refugee MHPs. Conclusion(s): A worldwide effort of over 200 psychiatrists and MHPs have provided professional support to over 1000 psychotherapists in Ukraine and 200 in Poland, resulting in psychosocial treatment for thousands of Ukrainian children and youth in Ukraine and Poland. The war in the middle of Europe has reinforced the importance of social psychiatry, involving child and adolescent psychiatrists and others, and the necessity of inter-mental health professional role collaboration.

N2  - Substance use, HIV/AIDS, domestic violence and mental health (SAVAME) are syndemic health issues that disproportionately burden Latinos in the U.S. Yet, there are limited evidence-based interventions to address these interrelated syndemic issues and their shared socio-ecological determinants. This study sought to test the feasibility and acceptability of CRiSOL, a peer-based, resilience-focused intervention to reduce the impact of the SAVAME syndemic on Latino immigrants. Fifteen Latino immigrant community leaders were recruited and trained to serve as health promotion agents in their naturally existing social networks. The training was implemented with high fidelity, received with high satisfaction by the peer leaders, and associated with significant improvements in their knowledge, leadership skills, and social capital. During an 8-month outreach phase, nine leaders remained active in the program and documented 825 one-on-one interactions with community members, during which they provided advice/counseling (52.2% of interactions), health information/education (32.5%), referrals to health and social services (38.5%), food aid (39.9%), and service navigation/assistance (10.2%). While future research must be conducted to establish the effectiveness of CRiSOL, findings from this pilot evaluation indicate the feasibility, acceptability, and high level of reach of this intervention and suggest significant potential to reduce the SAVAME syndemic burden in Latino communities.Copyright © 2023 Martinez-Donate et al.

N2  - The workplace represents a relevant source of stress for workers, being a risk factor for many mental disorders and psychological difficulties, including burn-out syndrome. Healthcare workers and other help-professions are particularly susceptible to work-related stress. The present systematic review aims to (1) identify available interventions for managing workplace-related stress symptoms; (2) assess their efficacy; and (3) discuss the current limitations of available interventions. A systematic review has been conducted, searching on PubMed, APA PsycInfo, and Scopus databases. Eighteen papers have been identified, which included different interventions for the management of work-related stress in healthcare professionals. These approaches can be grouped as follows: (1) interventions focusing on the individual level using cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches; (2) interventions focusing on the individual level using relaxation techniques; and (3) interventions focusing on the organizational level. As regards interventions targeting the individual level using CBT approaches, mindfulness-based interventions were effective in reducing levels of burn-out, stress, and anxiety and in improving quality of life. As regards intervention using relaxation techniques, including art therapy, Emotional Freedom Techniques (ECT) and brief resilience retreats had a positive effect on the levels of anxiety, stress, and burnout. As regards interventions at the organizational level, we found no evidence for supporting its effectiveness in reducing the levels of burnout. Furthermore, available studies are heterogeneous in terms of assessment tools, target populations, and type of interventions, which limits the generalizability of findings.

N2  - Background and Objectives: The fatigue, stress, and burnout of nurses lead to them frequently making mistakes, which have a negative impact not only on the safety of the patients but also on their psychology. The ability to bounce back from mistakes is crucial for nurses. Nursing staff members' physical and mental health, particularly their depression, is far from ideal, and this ill health is directly correlated with the frequency of self-reported medical errors. The nurses' mental and physical health are also positively correlated with their perception of wellness support at work. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the status of nurses' mental and physical health regarding clinical errors and the impact of resilience on coping with these situations. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 364 healthcare professionals participated in this research; 87.5% of them were females and 12.5% of them were males. Most of the participants were 22-35 years old. The median number of years of employment was nine. Clinical nurses anonymously and voluntarily completed a special structured questionnaire that included questions from different validated tools in order to assess their state of physical and mental wellbeing after events of stress and errors made during their practice. Result(s): In total, 49.4% of the nurses had made an error on their own, and 73.2% had witnessed an error that someone else had made. At the time of the error, 29.9% of the participants were in charge of more than 20 patients, while 28.9% were responsible for a maximum of three patients. Participants who were 36-45 years old had more resilience (p = 0.049) and experienced fewer negative emotions than participants who were 22-35 years old. The participants who mentioned more positive feelings according to their mental state had greater resilience (p > 0.001). Conclusion(s): Errors were likely to happen during clinical practice due to nurses' negative experiences. The level of resilience among the nursing population was found to play a very important role not only in making mistakes but also in coping with errors during their daily routine. Wellness and prevention must be given top priority in all healthcare systems across the country in order to promote nurses' optimal health and wellbeing, raise the standard of care, and reduce the likelihood of expensive, avoidable medical errors. Healthcare administrations should promote prevention programs for stress occurrence in order to support nurses' wellbeing maintenance.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The term "scanxiety" has been coined to describe the anxiety commonly associated with individuals undergoing cancer-related imaging. Despite the prevalence and severity of scanxiety across various clinical and demographic populations, there remains a significant lack of qualitative insights from existing studies that effectively capture patients' experiences of scanxiety in their own words. Therefore, this review addresses the following research question: What are the experiences of scanxiety distress among people affected by cancer across the cancer care continuum? DATA SOURCES: Following the PRISMA methodology, a meta-aggregation of qualitative studies was performed, encompassing patients of all age groups who had been diagnosed with cancer or were indicated for a cancer-related scan. Of the 556 articles screened, 15 were deemed eligible for inclusion in the analysis. CONCLUSION(S): The three overarching themes of 1) experience of "scan-itis," 2) experience of "patient-clinician support," and 3) development of self-management strategies reveal the complex and interconnected factors that influence scanxiety in individuals undergoing cancer-related imaging. These findings emphasized distress experienced by patients during the waiting period for scan results, the act of viewing the results, and even the delivery of "bad" news. Consequently, patients expressed a strong desire for increased information, communication, and empathy from attending healthcare providers. Patients also report a myriad of self-coping strategies to manage their scanxiety well before, during, and after their scan appointment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The study highlights the need for targeted interventions for those undergoing cancer-related scans, including increased awareness and education for health professionals regarding scanxiety.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

N2  - Objectives: Decades of research have demonstrated that selective and indicated preventive interventions can reduce mental health problems and promote positive developmental outcomes in children, youth, and families; however, the dissemination of these interventions within community settings has lagged far behind. We describe the ongoing implementation of an evidence-based suite of prevention interventions adapted to address the demands of wartime stress on military families. Implemented at scale for active-duty military families for over 15 years, FOCUS (Families OverComing Under Stress) provides a framework for implementing prevention within systems of care, including ongoing adaptation processes needed to engage and flexibly adapt interventions within culturally diverse communities and for evolving public health needs. Method(s): We describe challenges and opportunities with the implementation of FOCUS as a suite of trauma-informed prevention interventions. Core processes include a tiered population-level public health model, community partnered adaptation of core elements, and continuous quality improvement processes supporting delivery, training, and an iterative, adaptive "Learning Health System." Adaptations, screening, and engagement tools, including mobile apps, web-based platforms, and in-home teleprevention platforms, will be presented. Result(s): We will describe outcomes from the implementation of FOCUS in military and school-based classroom settings, including the impact on child and parental well-being as well as the governmental, organizational, and funding challenges to sustaining prevention within systems of care. This learning system implementation approach to support implementation within community mental health settings, including schools, will be presented. Conclusion(s): An adaptive framework for implementing prevention requires an infrastructure that supports personalized delivery that is both timely and culturally responsive. A screening and data monitoring system that supports early risk identification and stepped prevention/care, monitoring for leadership and policymakers, and the opportunity to incorporate practice-based evidence with evidence-based practices as interventions are delivered in the real world, are central to successful integration of prevention practices into larger systems of care.

N2  - Objectives: Countertransference is defined as the feelings evoked within the doctor by either personal history or verbal and nonverbal behavior. Understanding the role of countertransference in clinical practice is emphasized in the training of psychiatry residents; however, these skills are not emphasized in other specialties. Pitfalls to not understanding countertransference include enactment (defined as unintentionally acting on countertransference) and the emotionally draining nature of work that can negatively impact trainee resiliency and increase burnout. In this project, we aim to address this gap in education for nonpsychiatry residency programs. Method(s): Presentations were given to 5 different residency and fellowship programs of an academic institution that included pediatrics, urology, internal medicine, orthopedic surgery, and addiction medicine. The presentation was an hour-long session that included introduction, historical context of countertransference, case-based approach to understanding countertransference, and time for discussion. Attendees were given a pre- and postpresentation survey to assess the training. Result(s): Differences in mean Likert scores before and after the intervention were assessed with paired t tests to explore the impact of the sessions, including the understanding, relevance of countertransference, and how it can be applied to clinical practice among trainees (n = 51). Understanding countertransference significantly improved postsession from a mean of 3.2 to a mean of 4.7 (t = 11.2; p <.001). Believing countertransference was relevant significantly improved postsession from a mean of 3.5 to a mean of 4.6 (t = 9.0; p <.001). Understanding how to apply countertransference also significantly improved postsession from a mean of 2.9 to a mean of 4.4 (t = 11.2; p <.001). Ninety-eight percent of respondents reported that they were likely to recommend this training to others (scored > 5 on a scale of 1-10). Conclusion(s): Based on our preliminary data, there is a lack of education on countertransference in graduate medical education outside of psychiatry. There is also a clear interest from residents to learn more about the topic. Future directions of the project include an additional postsurvey at the 3-month mark to better understand retention and application of the topics discussed. REST, TR, WLCopyright © 2023

N2  - Objectives: Attendees will be able to: describe how trauma can present as violence in schools; understand the role that schools can play in youth mental health; and identify school-based programs with evidence for decreasing violence. Method(s): North Carolina (NC) is an awardee of 2 national Project AWARE (Advancing Wellness and Resiliency in Education) SAMHSA grants. NC Project AWARE focuses on training school staff in trauma-informed practices, creating school policies that support mental health, and community engagement. Universal mental health screening for students and comprehensive suicide risk and behavioral threat assessment tools are utilized. Data presented are descriptive data, aggregated by Anlar, and collected through multiple sources, including the NC Teacher Working Conditions Survey, NC Department of Public Instruction Report Card Resources, School Health Assessment and Performance Evaluation System survey data, and process data reported by the districts. Result(s): The first cohort of NC Project AWARE includes 3 counties, with about 24,000 students. At baseline, 75.8% of students in the 3 districts qualified for free or reduced-price lunch, and 43% of the students identified as a race or ethnicity other than non-Hispanic White. They have trained more than 5000 staff in behavioral health promotion. In 2022, more than 4000 students were referred for behavioral health services, with a 91% access rate. From 2020 to 2022, teachers in Project AWARE districts had a 10% increase in agreement that bullying was not a frequent problem compared to the state average of a 2% increase. In-school suspension rates decreased by 91% in Project AWARE districts, compared to a 36% statewide decrease across the same time period. Conclusion(s): Experiencing trauma in childhood is a risk factor for violence, which can manifest within schools. Evidence-based programs exist that can be utilized in schools to facilitate a trauma-informed environment and early identification and management of mental health concerns. Process data from NC Project AWARE indicates that these practices can move the needle on rates of bullying and suspensions. Child and adolescent psychiatrists are acutely aware of the youth mental health crisis and dire workforce shortage. As an environment in which the majority of children and adolescents spend their time, schools are an important partner to continue collaborating with to reach youth where they are.

N2  - There is a growing need for interventions to improve well-being in healthcare workers, particularly since the onset of COVID-19. Objectives To synthesise evidence since 2015 on the impact of interventions designed to address well-being and burnout in physicians, nurses and allied healthcare professionals. Design Systematic literature review. Data sources Medline, Embase, Emcare, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Google Scholar were searched in May-October 2022. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies that primarily investigated burnout and/or well-being and reported quantifiable preintervention and postintervention outcomes using validated well-being measures were included. Data extraction and synthesis Full-text articles in English were independently screened and quality assessed by two researchers using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument. Results were synthesised and presented in both quantitative and narrative formats. Meta-analysis was not possible due to variations in study designs and outcomes. Results A total of 1663 articles were screened for eligibility, with 33 meeting inclusion criterium. Thirty studies used individually focused interventions, while three were organisationally focused. Thirty-one studies used secondary level interventions (managed stress in individuals) and two were primary level (eliminated stress causes). Mindfulness-based practices were adopted in 20 studies; the remainder used meditation, yoga and acupuncture. Other interventions promoted a positive mindset (gratitude journaling, choirs, coaching) while organisational interventions centred on workload reduction, job crafting and peer networks. Effective outcomes were reported in 29 studies, with significant improvements in well-being, work engagement, quality of life and resilience, and reductions in burnout, perceived stress, anxiety and depression. Conclusion The review found that interventions benefitted healthcare workers by increasing well-being, engagement and resilience, and reducing burnout. It is noted that the outcomes of numerous studies were impacted by design limitations that is, no control/waitlist control, and/or no post intervention follow-up. Suggestions are made for future research.Copyright © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: To determine whether a nurse-led care model with telemonitoring in primary care for patients with stable heart failure and their caregivers is feasible and acceptable. Patients and Methods: A mixed-methods feasibility study was conducted. Patients with stable heart failure and their caregivers were consecutively enrolled from March 2021 to April 2022. Participants were managed by nurses in a community health center through education and monitoring with a mobile app. The outcomes were feasibility outcomes, self-care outcomes, and qualitative acceptability and satisfaction. Quantitative and qualitative outcomes were linked to understanding how the model of care might benefit patients. Result(s): Twenty-six patients and nine of their caregivers were enrolled. Ten participants used the mobile app. Nineteen patients and eight caregivers were interviewed. Participants who improved their self-care appreciated the help in finding coping strategies, being close to the clinic, and feeling cared for. Participants with fewer improvements in self-care perceived the model of care as useless and were far from the centre. Participants decided to use the app mainly for usefulness prevision, and most of them were satisfied. Conclusion(s): The model of care was not successful in recruiting patients, and adjustments are needed to improve the recruitment strategy and to engage people who perceive the model of care as not useful or unable to use the app.Copyright © 2023 Longhini et al.

T1  - Burnout in emergency department staff: The prevalence and barriers to intervention
A1  - Naidoo R.
A1  - Schoeman R. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Background: Burnout impacts patient care and staff well-being. Emergency department (ED) staff are at an elevated risk for burnout. Despite an acceleration in burnout research due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is limited data on the nature and prevalence of burnout in the South African emergency medicine setting. Aim(s): This study determined the prevalence of burnout in ED staff (doctors, nurses and non-clinical staff) at Tygerberg Hospital and explored staff awareness and utilisation of interventions. Setting(s): The study was conducted at Tygerberg Hospital, South Africa. Method(s): This cross-sectional study used the Maslach Burnout Inventory to assess burnout via a self-administered electronic survey in a convenience sample of 109 ED staff. Quantitative data were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Result(s): A total of 46 participants (45.10%) experienced burnout, with 73 participants (71.57%) at high risk for emotional exhaustion or depersonalisation. The prevalence of burnout in doctors was 57.89%, non-clinical staff was 25.93%, and nursing staff was 50.00%. Burnout was higher in doctors and nursing staff compared to non-clinical staff, with high emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation found in interns and specialist professional nurses. The level of intervention awareness was 41.8% and the level of intervention utilisation was 8.82%. Thematic analysis identified awareness, accessibility and reactive utilisation as barriers to utilisation with opportunities to reduce burnout and enhance resilience. Conclusion(s): Coordinated health system and organisational efforts are required to optimise intervention strategies to reduce burnout. Contribution: Guidance on the design and planning of intervention strategies considering at risk groups, intervention-related factors, and non-clinical staff.Copyright © 2023. The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Climate change, an underlying risk driver of natural disasters, threatens the environmental sustainability, planetary health, and sustainable development goals. Incorporating disaster-related health impacts into electronic health records helps to comprehend their impact on populations, clinicians, and healthcare systems. This study aims to: (1) map the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction and International Science Council (UNDRR-ISC) Hazard Information Profiles to SNOMED CT International, a clinical terminology used by clinicians, to manage patients and provide healthcare services; and (2) to determine the extent of clinical terminologies available to capture disaster-related events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Concepts related to disasters were extracted from the UNDRR-ISC's Hazard Information Profiles and mapped to a health terminology using a procedural framework for standardized clinical terminology mapping. The mapping process involved evaluating candidate matches and creating a final list of matches to determine concept coverage. RESULT(S): A total of 226 disaster hazard concepts were identified to adversely impact human health. Chemical and biological disaster hazard concepts had better representation than meteorological, hydrological, extraterrestrial, geohazards, environmental, technical, and societal hazard concepts in SNOMED CT. Heatwave, drought, and geographically unique disaster hazards were not found in SNOMED CT. CONCLUSION(S): To enhance clinical reporting of disaster hazards and climate-sensitive health outcomes, the poorly represented and missing concepts in SNOMED CT must be included. Documenting the impacts of climate change on public health using standardized clinical terminology provides the necessary real time data to capture climate-sensitive outcomes. These data are crucial for building climate-resilient healthcare systems, enhanced public health disaster responses and workflows, tracking individual health outcomes, supporting disaster risk reduction modeling, and aiding in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Introduction: Within the EULAR recommendations, patient education (PE) is stated as the basis of the management of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). However, educational needs are scarcely qualitatively studied in axSpA. Therefore, we aimed to explore experiences and needs of PE in patients with axSpA. Method(s): A phenomenological approach was used, with semi-structured in-depth interviews with patients with axSpA including broad variation in characteristics. Thematic analysis was applied. To enhance credibility, data saturation, research triangulation, peer debriefing, member checking, theoretical notes, and bracketing were performed. Result(s): Three interrelated themes regarding PE were identified from 20 interviews: illness perception, content, and 'availability'. Illness perception affects how patients experience and process PE, which consequently influences coping strategies. Prognosis, treatment, and coaching to self-management were identified as the most important content of PE. Regarding 'availability', face-to-face PE is preferred for exploring needs, supplemented by self-education, which can be freely applied. Additionally, sufficient time and a comprehensible amount of information were important and participants emphasized the need for axSpA-tailored information for relatives and friends. Participants reported a trusting patient-healthcare provider (HCP) relationship, and multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary attunement between HCPs as prerequisites for effective PE. Conclusion(s): This first qualitative study exploring patients' experiences and needs of PE in axSpA revealed that prognosis, treatment, and coaching to self-management are important regarding content, and the combination of face-to-face contact and self-education the preferred modalities. It seems essential that patients' illness perceptions are taken into account for effective PE. These results add relevant insights for future PE guidelines in axSpA.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: Develop and pilot test a mobile health (mHealth) cognitive behavioral coping skills training and activity coaching protocol (HCT Symptoms and Steps) for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) patients. Design(s): Two-phase, mixed methods study. Sample: HCT patients and healthcare providers. Method(s): Phase I was patient (n = 5) and provider (n = 1) focus groups and user testing (N = 5) to develop the HCT Symptoms and Steps protocol. Phase II was a pilot randomized trial (N = 40) to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and pre-to-post outcomes (e.g., physical disability, pain, fatigue, distress, physical activity, symptom self-efficacy) compared to an education control. Finding(s): Qualitative feedback on symptoms, recruitment strategies, coping skills, and mHealth components (e.g., Fitbit, mobile app) were integrated into the protocol. HCT Symptoms and Steps were feasible and acceptable. Pre-post changes suggest physical disability and activity improved while symptoms (e.g., fatigue, distress) decreased. Conclusion(s): HCT Symptoms and Steps have strong feasibility and acceptability and shows promise for benefits. Larger, fully-powered randomized trials are needed to examine intervention efficacy. Implications: HCT Symptoms and Steps may reduce physical disability and improve health outcomes post-transplant.

N2  - AIM: To explore the resilience of children, six to thirteen years old, living on a Northern Plains American Indian Reservation using a situation specific nursing theory. BACKGROUND: American Indian and Alaska Native children experience mental health inequities compared to their white peers, including substance use, suicide, depression, and anxiety. Resilience is a strength of children that can be leveraged to improve their mental health. DESIGN: A parallel convergent mixed methods design. METHOD(S): A community advisory board culturally adapted resilience instruments. During two weeks in summer 2022, forty-seven children/caregiver dyads completed surveys about the child's resilience. Descriptive statistics gave the scores of each child's personal, relational, and total resilience. A subset of 20 children participated in a semi-structured interview. RESULT(S): Children scored high on overall resilience, and higher on the relational subscale than the personal subscale. Caregiver survey scores were not significantly correlated with their child's scores and were higher than the children's scores. Qualitative coding revealed six themes of resilience. Integration of data showed a concordance and expansion of the quantitative data across themes. CONCLUSION(S): The children reported high resilience supported by a strong ecosystem of relationships. Resilience, as explained through children's voices, corroborated with findings from the surveys. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Findings will help nurses across sectors of primary, secondary, and tertiary care create resilience-enhancing interventions and prevent mental health crises in this community. IMPACT STATEMENT: This findings from this study will inform local mental health interventions on the Reservation. The study provides a reproducible design to adapt to other Indigenous communities. PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A community advisory board was a partner in every stage of the study. Children and caregivers participated in data collection. CONTRIBUTION TO THE WIDER CLINICAL COMMUNITY: This research provides knowledge that will further social justice efforts within nursing to promote health equity across diverse populations.Copyright © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patient and visitor violence (PVV) is a widespread problem for health professionals. Nurses working in intensive care units (ICUs) face a relatively high risk of experiencing PVV, which significantly impacts both the health of nurses and the institution as a whole. The subjective perceptions of ICU nurses regarding PVV are inadequately explored in the literature. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives, experiences, and perceptions of PVV in ICU nurses and to better understand the precipitating factors of violence. METHOD(S): A phenomenological qualitative design and purposive sampling were used. A semistructured interview guide was used to conduct in-depth interviews with 12 ICU nurses with PVV experiences. Giorgi's method of analysis was used to discover and identify the essential categories of experience. RESULT(S): Five main experience categories were identified: family and patient factors as flashpoints, managing suppressed emotions by weathering the emotional storm, spiritual awakening after violence, and strategies for surviving further violence. The participants' experiences with PVV included a range of caring and mental health difficulties. In ICU settings, patient progress is often unpredictable, resulting in discrepancies between patient/family expectations and reality. Because feelings of frustration and powerlessness can eventually cause exhaustion in ICU nurses, implementing effective emotional management, stress adjustment, psychological counseling, team support, and violence intervention programs are crucial. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study provides new information on the process by which nurses can progress from inner trauma to self-recovery, moving from a negative affectivity disposition to a better understanding of threat appraisals and coping response options. Nurses should increase their awareness of the complexity of the phenomenon and of the interplay among the factors underlying PVV. The results of this study suggest that routine confusion and delirium assessments to rule out patients with ICU delirium in ICUs are important to preventing PVV. This study considers some of the implications of the research findings for nursing managers. Interventions, training programs, and/or management action should be used to ensure psychological and mental support is extended to all witnesses of PVV events and not only to those targeted by violence.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The study was conducted in order to determine the effect of mandala therapy applied to mothers who have children with special needs on the mothers' comfort and resilience levels. METHOD(S): The study was conducted as a randomized controlled study at a special education school in Turkey. The study sample consisted of 51 mothers (24 mothers in the experimental group and 27 mothers in the control group) who had children with special needs. A 16-h mandala therapy was applied to the mothers in the experimental group. Identifying Information Form, General Comfort Questionnaire and Adult Resilience Scale were used as data collection tools. RESULT(S): According to the regression analysis performed in order to explain the difference between the first and third measurements of General Comfort Questionnaire, mandala art therapy was found to be effective, and the model established was determined to be statistically significant. It was also determined that the change that occurred between the third and first measurements performed in order to identify the change in the general comfort levels of the individuals was higher in the experimental group in comparison to the control group (P<0.05). It was seen that the mothers' mean scores obtained from the Adult Resilience Scale total scale and its subscales significantly increased in the second and third measurements (P<0.05) but that the increase in the mean scores of the control group was not significant (P>0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Mandala Art Therapy is a method that improves the comfort levels and resilience of mothers who have children with special needs. It might be beneficial for mothers to perform these applications at special education schools in collaboration with nurses.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Objectives Religion may impact perspectives and clinical decision-making for people with differences of sex development (DSD). Given the importance of religion for most Americans, the literature reporting on the role of religion/faith in DSD is surprisingly scant and these factors are not consistently integrated into DSD healthcare delivery. We explored DSD stakeholder views on the importance and intersection of religion, faith and spirituality within the delivery of clinical care for people with DSD. Methods DSD stakeholders from across the US (n=110), comprising individuals with DSD (n=24; aged 15-39y), parents (n=19), multidisciplinary DSD healthcare providers (n=37), and other allied professionals (n=30), were recruited as part of the Defining Successful Outcomes and Trade-offs Study. Stakeholders participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews, in which they were asked what constitutes a successful outcome for those with DSD and how to achieve it. To focus on religion, faith and spirituality, we identified transcript passages for analysis using relevant keywords. A qualitative phenomenological approach was used to identify overarching themes and significant topics. Results Overall, religion was identified as an important factor in how individuals understand DSD and make decisions regarding care delivery, and in impacting psychosocial adaptation and outcomes. Participants with minimal/no religious affiliation reported more freedom in decision-making. For those with religious affiliations and faith, some found comfort and purpose (creational intent) through their faith; others expressed guilt or rejection if choices led to 'sin'. Foundational beliefs underpinning gender - including family/social order, sexuality and reproductive potential - influenced clinical decisionmaking around gender of rearing, genital surgery and fertility options. Religious communities may reinforce and affect beliefs and experiences, with some receiving support, acceptance and healing, but others encountering misinformation and rejection. Conclusions Integrating religion/faith is important to optimize patient- and family-centered DSD care and outcomes. Education is needed for both religious communities and providers. Asking families about the importance of religion/faith to them and their care represents an early step. Involving hospital chaplaincy, if indicated, may provide a bridge to promote spiritual health and resilience and complement DSD team care.

N2  - Background: Health teaching is an essential part of the patient journey at any healthcare facility. Internal audit was carried out in one of the renowned healthcare institutions in the middle east , specifically in the outpatient department. The audit revealed the existence of some issues regarding patients' familiarity with some aspects of knowledge about their conditions, medications, healthy diets, etc..... Therefore, it was necessary to assess the patient's understanding and to re-evaluate the introduced instructions regarding these topics. Nursing leaders in the aforementioned institution were inspired to conduct a quality improvement project that enhanced the patients outcome by assessing patient understanding concerning inpatient health teaching. Aim(s): A quality improvement project aimed at assessing patients' understanding regarding health teaching after open-heart surgeries during their hospital stay. Process: A survey was conducted to assess the patient understanding regarding healthy diet , wound care after surgery, taking the medications, understanding diagnosis, daily activities, follow-up visits and deal with an emergency. Nurse leaders formed a group of internship nursing students to conduct the survey immediately after a health teaching process. Data was collected and analyzed. Some interventions were implemented to fill the gap of health teaching process and improve the patients outcome. Intervention(s): There were no leaflets or other health teaching materials that could be offered to the patient. 15 health education leaflets were developed to fill in this gap. The health teaching process took place at the time of discharge and the decision was to proceed the patient education from the time of admission. We validated and reinforced the health teaching content with the patient and family before discharge.All patients agreed that their relatives should attend the health teaching sessions and these interventions affected positively the results of survey. Data Analysis: A group of 100 patients were involved in this survey and results revealed the following. It was found that there was a significant impact of the intervention, as shown in ( Figure 1). 69% of patients were only aware about their healthy diet compared with 92% after intervention. Regarding wound care, there was a 14% increase of patient awareness after the intervention. There was a significant difference in terms of the patient understanding about their own diagnosis after the process intervention that reached 27%. The survey showed satisfying numbers before and after the teaching process of follow up date and emergency contact. Recommendations: Patient teaching is a continuous process starts from the day of admission.Each patient has a suitable way to cope with the provided information in terms of many aspects such as the education level, availability of relative.

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Introduction: Cardiovascular Disease leads to physical and psychosocial problems and worsens the quality of life of patients. Cardiovascular Disease Management is focused not only on reducing morbidity and mortality, but also on opportunities to improve daily life and overcome risk factors. Nurses play a key role in patient health education and their contributions have expanded in recent decades in Bulgaria. Purpose(s): The aim of this study was to explore the possibilities for nurses' active participation in the health education of patients with Cardiovascular Disease. Method(s): The study included 146 patients with Cardiovascular Disease and a control group. The mean age of the respondents is 61.15 +/- 2.35. The practical part of the study included 52 patients. The toolkit contains questionnaires for assessing stress and coping with everyday life, behavioral risk factors, a health education program and self-care. All participants have signed an informed consent, in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Result(s): The results of physical activity, routine activities, self-care and anxiety show some disorders in the patient group. Patients with anxiety were 49.3%, individuals in the control group were 21.9%, (chi2 = 23.89, p <0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in anxiety level between patients and the control group (t = 4.07, p <0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in the relative shares of the two groups in terms of anxiety and physical activity (Z = 7.09, p = 0.000). Patients with self-care difficulties and anxiety are 24.0%. A relationship between anxiety and self-care options was found in patients (Z = 6.29; p = 0.000). A structured interview was conducted to identify lifestyle risk factors. The results show that 55.8% of patients are overweight. The relationship between waist circumference and BMI is straight moderate (r = 0.397, p = 0.004). The predominant number of men who smoke is 60.7%. A relationship was established between smoking and the gender of the respondents (chi2 = 18.21, df = 2, p = 0.000). The nurse conducted an individual interview with each patient to improve diet, daily routine, control blood pressure, blood sugar and more. A pedagogical model for health education was applied, based on goal setting, motivation, and self-care to achieve long-term results in terms of risk factor management. Positive changes were reported after 3 months in terms of hygiene and diet, physical activity, regular monitoring of blood pressure and medication. Conclusion(s): Patient education is one of the most important aspects of nurses' work. Primary care nurses are a key factor in improving the quality of life of patients by implementing self-care education programs, reducing risk factors and monitoring the condition.

N2  - Background:The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has necessitated widespread lockdown to mitigate the pandemic. This study examines the influence of resilience on the impact of COVID-related stress and enforced lockdown on mental health, drug use, and treatment adherence among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Argentina. Setting(s):PLWH residing predominantly in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area and urban regions of Argentina were identified from a private clinic electronic database. Method(s):Participants completed an anonymous online survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on economic disruption, resilience, mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness), adherence to HIV treatment, and substance use. We performed ordinary least squares and logistic regressions to test whether resilient coping buffered the impact of economic disruption on mental health and drug use during quarantine. Result(s):A total of 1336 PLWH aged 18-82 were enrolled. The impact of economic disruption on mental health DELTAF(1,1321) = 8.86, P = 0.003 and loneliness DELTAF(1,1326) = 5.77, P = 0.016 was buffered by resilience. A 3-way interaction between resilient buffering, stress, and sex was significant DELTAF(1,1325) = 4.76, P = 0.029. Participants reported less than excellent adherence to medication (33%), disruption to mental health services (11%), and disruption to substance abuse treatment (1.3%) during lockdown. Discussion(s):The impact of COVID-stress and lockdown on emotional distress seemed mitigated by resilience coping strategies, and the buffering impact of resilience on perceived stress was greater among women. Results highlight PLWH's capacity to adhere to treatment in challenging circumstances and the importance of developing resilience skills for better coping with stress and adversity.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  - Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs more commonly in military veterans than the general population. Whilst current therapies are effective, up to half of veterans commencing treatment do not complete it. Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories (RTM) protocol is a novel, easy to train, talking therapy with promising findings. We examine the feasibility of undertaking an efficacy trial of RTM in veterans. Method(s): A parallel group, single-centre randomised controlled feasibility trial with a post-completion qualitative interview study. Sixty military veterans were randomised 2:1 to RTM (n = 35) or Trauma Focussed Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) (n = 25). We aimed to determine the rate of recruitment and retention, understand reasons for attrition, determine data quality and size of efficacy signal. We explored veterans' perceptions of experiences of joining the trial, the research procedures and therapy, and design improvements for future veteran studies. Military veterans with a diagnosis of PTSD or complex PTSD, and clinically significant symptoms, were recruited between January 2020 and June 2021. Primary outcome was feasibility using pre-determined progression criteria alongside PTSD symptoms, with depression, recovery, and rehabilitation as secondary outcomes. Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 20 weeks. Interviews (n = 15) were conducted after 20 weeks. Both therapies were delivered by trained charity sector provider therapists. Result(s): Participants' mean age was 53 years, the mean baseline PTSD symptoms score assessed by the Post-traumatic Stress Checklist (PCL-5) was 57 (range 0-80). Fifty had complex PTSD and 39 had experienced >= 4 traumas. Data were analysed at 20 weeks for feasibility outcomes (n = 60) and mental health outcomes (n = 45). Seven of eight progression criteria were met. The RTM group experienced a mean 18-point reduction on the PCL-5. TFCBT group participants experienced a mean reduction of eight points. Forty-eight percent of the RTM group no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD compared to 16% in the TFCBT group. All veterans reported largely positive experiences of the therapy and research procedures and ways to improve them. Conclusion(s): RTM therapy remains a promising psychological intervention for the treatment of PTSD, including complex PTSD, in military veterans. With specific strengthening, the research protocol is fit for purpose in delivering an efficacy trial. Trial registration: ISRCTN registration no 10314773 on 01.10.2019.

N2  - Introduction and aim. COVID-19 intensity has affected both the psychology of the nurses and the balance established between their work and social lives. In this study, it was aimed to examine the work-life balance and psychological resilience levels of nurses. Material and methods. Four Hundred and seventy two nurses, working in various hospitals and internal units in Turkey, voluntarily participated in the study. Data was collected online using the Work-Life Balance Scale, Brief Psychological Resilience Scale, and the Personal Information Form. Results. The sub-dimensions of the work-life balance scale include allocation of time for yourself (beta=1.892; p<0.001), life merely being based on work (beta=-0.513; p<0.05) and work-life balance; affect the psychological resilience score (beta=-0.364; p<0.05). Based on this, devoting time for yourself has a positive effect on psychological resilience, while others have a negative effect. The total score of the nurses on work-life balance is 51.51+/-7.22 and their psychological resilience score is 15.27+/-3.93. Conclusion. Psychological resilience is affected by educational status, marital status, having children, and working schedule; work-life balance is affected by educational status, marital status, having children, income levels, and working schedule; while work-life balance sub-dimensions are affected by education, marital status, having children, income levels, place of work and working schedule. Both work-life balance and its sub-dimensions affect the psychological resilience of nurses.Copyright © 2023 Via Medica

N2  - Background: Being diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease is a life-changing event and a critical time to help patients cope and move forward in a proactive way. Historically, the main focus of Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment has been on the motor features with limited attention given to non-motor and mental health sequelae, which have the most impact on quality of life. Although depression and anxiety have been described at the time of PD diagnosis, demoralization, intolerance of uncertainty, decreased self-efficacy, stigma and loneliness can also present and have negative effects on the trajectory of the disease. Hence, understanding the psychological impact of the diagnosis and how to provide better counselling at this critical time point may be the key to a better long-term trajectory and quality of life. Focus: There has been a paradigm shift in the treatment of chronic illness moving beyond the medical model, which focuses on fighting illness with the physician being in charge of the treatment process and the patient being the passive recipient, toward a more holistic (i.e., physical, psychological, social, and spiritual health) biopsychosocial approach that emphasizes behavioral factors with the patient being an active collaborator in their treatment. Hence, we propose that fostering resilience, social support, and psychological flexibility offer promise toward attenuating negative reactions and improving overall well-being. Conclusion(s): Through a proactive wellness approach incorporating lifestyle choices, people with PD (PwP) can not only achieve improved states of health, well-being, and quality of life, but actually thrive.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Background: Compassion fatigue adversely affects nurses' physical and mental health, and negatively affect patient outcomes. However, there is no study evaluating the indirect effect of 'Compassion Fatigue Resiliency Program (CFRP)', given to nurses, on patient satisfaction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the CFRP applied to oncology nurses on the professional quality of life and stress levels of nurses, the satisfaction of cancer patients. Method(s): This experimental embedded mixed methods design study was conducted between 2022-2023 with 15 oncology nurses, 19 cancer patients and 6 nurse managers at a comprehensive oncology center in Istanbul. In the first phase of the three-stage study (pre-intervention phase), in-depth individual interviews were conducted with cancer patients, and instruments were applied to nurses and patients, respectively. In the second phase (intervention phase), CFRP was applied to the nurses. In the third phase (post-intervention phase), individual interviews were conducted with the same cancer patients and focus group interviews were conducted with the nurse managers, and the same measurement tools were reapplied to nurses and patients after the intervention. Result(s): The mean compassion satisfaction scores of nurses decreased; patient care satisfaction scores increased statistically significantly after the CFRP intervention (p<0.05). 6 themes were identified from interviews with patients: communication of nurses; level of responsiveness to needs; accessibility of nurses; psychological care; informing, suggestions for improving nursing; and 5 themes were identified from interviews with nurse managers: awareness; feeling valued, approach to patients, approach to colleagues, no change. Conclusion(s): After the CFRP applied to nurses, patient care satisfaction increased, while nurses' compassion satisfaction levels decreased. The qualitative data of the study showed the positive effects of CFRP for both nurses and patients from the perspective of nurses, patients and nurse managers.

N2  - Background: After sphincter-saving rectal cancer surgery, many patients experience bowel problems called low anterior resection syndrome (LARS). Especially major LARS (LARS-score >= 30) has a negative impact on patients' quality of life. Our previous research has shown that these patients have several information and counselling needs towards healthcare professionals. Patients without LARS (LARS score 0-20) or with minor LARS (LARS-score 21-29) experience less bowel problems which has less impact on their quality of life. The aim of this study was to explore the dynamics in experiences, information and counselling needs of patients without or with minor LARS. Method(s): A qualitative study based on the principles of a grounded theory was conducted. Rectal cancer survivors without LARS or with minor LARS were purposefully recruited in three large hospitals. Patients with major LARS, patients who have had an abdominoperineal resection with permanent stoma and patients who do not speak Dutch were excluded. Semi-structured interviews were performed. The constant comparative method and investigators' triangulation were used during data-analysis. Result(s): Fourteen patients were interviewed of which six patients without LARS and seven with minor LARS according to the LARS-score. In the first months, all 14 patients experienced LARS which had an impact on their family or working life. However, these symptoms improved over time resulting in a controllable situation. Additionally, patients described that LARS became less dominant and other symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy due to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were perceived worse. Factors such as having previous bowel problems during treatment, comparing themselves to patients experiencing major LARS or feeling euphoria about avoiding a permanent stoma reinforced their coping strategy. The amount of information patients received beforehand varied. Patients who received a high information load experienced anxiety but stated that this information was necessary to be prepared. Conclusion(s): The symptoms of patients without or with minor LARS were more controllable and became less dominant compared to major LARS. These insights are important to organize care for patients without or with minor LARS. Clinical trial identification: BC-11853. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors.

N2  - Background: Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) can control the disease state of patients with limited peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). In spite of the fact that it is an effective and promising treatment, it has a big impact on various aspects of patients' quality of life. The aim of this study is to explore experiences and needs of patients with digestive tumors after CRS/HIPEC (short and long-term). Method(s): An explorative qualitative design was used. Individual semi-structured interviews were performed with 15 patients (2-14 months postoperatively) between December 2020 and May 2021 in one expert university hospital in Belgium. Data-analysis was done using thematic analysis and investigators' triangulation was used. Result(s): Before surgery, patients relied on the expertise of the surgeon and saw the surgery as their only hope. After surgery, patients underestimated rehabilitation due to acute and long-term effects of the treatment. They described their relatives as a second victim but experienced their support at the same time. Patients were grateful for the future but also had fear for recurrence. Treatment by an experienced surgeon and the counseling of a clinical nurse specialist was seen as an added value. The need for contact with peers varied among patients. Conclusion(s): CRS/HIPEC has a large impact on patients' and their relatives' lives. Patients were confronted with short and long-term effects. The healthcare professionals (HCPs) should adapt the amount and kind of information before surgery to the coping mechanism of the patient. Counseling afterwards is necessary. HCPs should pay attention to the needs of the relatives as well and explore if the patients have a need to meet with peers. Clinical trial identification: B6702020000805.

N2  - Background: Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFR-I), such as cetuximab and panitumumab, are treatments that are frequently used in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. An important side effect of these treatments is skin toxicity, which has a negative impact on patients' quality of life. The aim of this study is to explore the dynamics and processes in the perception of colorectal cancer patients facing skin toxicity due to an EGFR-I. Method(s): An exploratory qualitative study was conducted, based on the principles of grounded theory. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were performed within two settings, namely a university hospital and a general hospital. The data were analyzed in a cyclical process through thematic analysis and investigator triangulation. For the main themes data saturation was achieved. Result(s): The dynamics and processes of the perception of skin toxicity were situated in three impact areas. First, patients described an impact on themselves due to the confrontation with symptoms and a lower self-esteem due to feelings of shame and insecurity caused by the visibility of skin toxicity. This also affected their self-management and the ability to cope with the toxicity. Second, patients outlined an impact of others. For example, comments caused insecurity and the need to hide their skin toxicity or isolate themselves. Additionally, their relatives had to support them in treating the skin toxicity, or skin toxicity sometimes led to an inability to work. Finally, patients stated that healthcare professionals provided emotional support and helped their coping process. In contrast, negative comments of others or from health care professionals could lead to insecurity or frustration. Conclusion(s): The side effect of skin toxicity not only has a physical impact but also affects the psychological and social aspects of a colorectal cancer patient's well-being. The digestive oncologist, dermatologist and nurse specialist should take this into account when counselling these patients. Additionally, there is a lack of knowledge about the impact of this side effect by healthcare professionals. Clinical trial identification: THE-2022-0147.

N2  - General practitioners are crucial in the primary healthcare system as well as for epidemic prevention and control. However, few researchers have examined their professional identity. This study investigated the current status of the professional identity of general practitioners in Chongqing, China and explored the effects of psychological capital and patient's contempt on their professional identity. From December 2021 to January 2022, randomized cluster sampling was used to conduct a cross-sectional online self-assessment questionnaire survey among general practitioners in Chongqing. In total, 2,180 general practitioners working for more than one year were selected. General practitioners' sense of professional identity, mental health, and sense of patients' disrespect were measured using the Professional Identity Scale, Psychological Capital Questionnaire, and Patient's Contempt Questionnaire. Sociodemographic characteristics were also collected. A multiple linear regression model was used to analyze the association between professional identity, psychological capital, and patient's contempt. The average score for professional identity among general practitioners was 53.59 (SD = 6.42). The scores for self-efficacy, hope, resilience, and optimism (subscales of psychological capital) were 26.87 (SD = 5.70), 26.47 (SD = 5.74), 26.97 (SD = 5.55), and 26.86 (SD = 5.59), respectively. The score for perceived contempt was 34.19 (SD = 7.59). An average monthly income greater than CNY 8,000 (beta = 1.018, p < 0.001), work tenure of more than 15 years (beta = 0.440, p = 0.001), hope (beta = 0.249, p < 0.001) and a higher optimism score (beta = 0.333, p < 0.001) were positively correlated with professional identity. Having a bachelor's degree and above (beta = -0.720, p = 0.014), an administrative role (beta = -1.456, p < 0.001), self-efficacy (beta = -0.122, p < 0.001), and higher patient's contempt (beta = -0.103, p < 0.001) were negatively associated with professional identity. General practitioners in Chongqing demonstrated high professional identity and a strong psychological status during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological capital and patient's contempt were associated with professional identity. To improve general practitioners' professional identity, stakeholders should promote practitioners' mental health and physician-patient relationships in China.Copyright: © 2023 Deng et al.

N2  - Introduction HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), in which people take HIV medication to prevent HIV acquisition, underpins global HIV transmission elimination strategies. Effective prevention needs people to adhere to PrEP and remain in care during periods of risk, but this is difficult to achieve. We undertook a process evaluation of Scotland's PrEP programme to explore barriers and facilitators to PrEP adherence and retention in care and to systematically develop evidence-based, theoretically-informed recommendations to address them. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews and focus groups (09/2018-07/2019) with patients who identified as gay or bisexual men and were either using PrEP, had declined the offer of PrEP, had stopped PrEP, or had been assessed as ineligible for PrEP (n = 39 of whom n = 5 (13%) identified as trans, median age 31 years and interquartile range 14 years), healthcare professionals involved in PrEP provision (n = 54 including specialist sexual health doctors and nurses of various grades, PrEP prescribing general practitioners, health promotion officers, midwifes, and a PrEP clinical secretary), and clients (n = 9) and staff (n = 15) of nongovernmental organisations with an HIV prevention remit across Scotland. We used thematic analysis to map key barriers and facilitators to priority areas that could enhance adherence and retention in care. We used implementation science analytic tools (Theoretical Domains Framework, Intervention Functions, Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy, APEASE criteria) and expert opinion to systematically generate recommendations. Results Barriers included perceived complexity of on-demand dosing, tendency for users to stop PrEP before seeking professional support, troublesome side-effects, limited flexibility in the settings/timings/nature of review appointments, PrEP-related stigma and emerging stigmas around not using PrEP. Facilitators included flexible appointment scheduling, reminders, and processes to follow up non-attenders. Examples of the 25 recommendations include: emphasising benefits of PrEP reviews and providing appointments flexibly within individualised PrEP care; using clinic systems to remind/recall PrEP users; supporting PrEP conversations among sexual partners; clear on-demand dosing guidance; encouraging good PrEP citizenship; detailed discussion on managing side-effects and care/coping planning activities. Conclusions PrEP adherence and retention in care is challenging, reducing the effectiveness of PrEP at individual and population levels. We identify and provide solutions to where and how collaborative interventions across public health, clinical, and community practice could address these challenges.Copyright: © 2023 MacDonald et al.

N2  - Depression, suicidal ideation, burnout, and moral injury are on the rise among physicians. Depression and suicidal ideation are mental health disorders that result from multiple interacting factors including biological vulnerabilities and acute stressors. Medical treatment for depression and suicidal ideation is critical to interrupt the potentially deadly progression to suicide that occurs when one's ability to find hope and other solutions is clouded by despair. Yet, stigma and perceived stigma of seeking treatment for mental health disorders still plagues medical providers. Transitions during medical training and practice can be particularly vulnerable time periods, though newer evidence suggests that overall, physicians are not at an increased risk of suicide compared to the general population. While burnout and moral injury are common among rehabilitation physicians, unlike depression, they are not directly associated with suicidal ideation. Opportunities for continued improvement in mental health resources and institutional support exist across the spectrum from medical student to staff physician. With wellness now increasingly supported and promoted by various medical organizations and recognition of the importance of access to effective mental health treatment, regaining hope and positivity while restoring resiliency in physicians, trainees, and medical students is possible.Copyright © 2023 - The authors.

N2  - Introduction: Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) is a rare chronic disease characterized by intestinal malabsorption due to abnormal intestinal anatomy or function that can result in intestinal failure (IF) with long-term dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN). Children with SBS grow up relying on medical professionals and caregivers for their survival. As more children with SBS survive into adulthood, patients eventually must transfer care to adult medical providers and facilities. The period of transition as a young patient prepares to transfer from pediatric to adult care providers is a crucial point in time that is increasingly recognized to carry risk for increased morbidity and mortality. In general, transition to adulthood is a crucial and vulnerable time marked by changing roles and responsibilities, social flux, and new relationships. In adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with SBS, this difficult period is compounded by the burden of a serious and chronic disease. Studies on health care transition (HCT) in AYAs with chronic gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and liver transplant suggest increased complications and psychosocial impairment. There is a paucity of data on this subject in AYAs with SBS. The aim of this study is to assess transition readiness, resilience, mental health, health literacy, SBS-specific quality of life (SBS-QoL), and barriers to HCT in AYAs with SBS. Method(s): We prospectively enrolled patients with SBS into our SBS healthcare transition program, the GUTSY Program: Gaining Understanding of Transition in Short Bowel Syndrome Among Youths. Inclusion criteria were patients with SBS over 12 years old, regardless of dependence upon PN, and ability to provide consent and/or assent to participate in the study. Children with severe neurocognitive delays that limited their ability to participate in transition readiness assessments were excluded from the study. Patients were administered the STARx and UNC TRxANSITION to assess transition readiness, CD-RISC-25 to measure resilience, PHQ-9 to screen for depression, GAD-7 to screen for anxiety, The Newest Vital Sign (NVS) to assess health literacy, and SBS-QoL tool to assess health-related quality of life. In addition, patients were given a brief open-ended qualitative survey to assess barriers and goals for HCT. Parents were administered the STARx to assess parent's perception of patient's transition readiness, the NVS to assess parental health literacy, and the Family Management Measure (FaMM) to assess the parent's perception of family management of SBS. Result(s): Participants included 16 patients with SBS, of which 13 were patient-parent dyads (12 mothers, 1 father). The mean AYA age was 18.1 years (range: 12-25 years) with 62.5% female; 50% Black or African American, 37.5% Hispanic, 31% White, and 19% Asian. The most common etiologies of SBS were necrotizing enterocolitis (44%), jejunal atresia (13%), IBD (13%), and intestinal injury from trauma (13%). The majority of the patients had colon in continuity (94%). Six patients (37.5%) were dependent on TPN, six (37.5%) were dependent on tube feeds, and three (19%) were dependent on both TPN and tube feeds. Four patients (25%) had mild developmental and neurocognitive delays. The mean STARx score for patients (60.4) was slightly higher than reported scores for AYAs with IBD (59), while mean parental STARx scores (57.2) were lower, and the mean UNC TRxANSITION score (4.8) was lower than reported scores for AYAs with other chronic conditions (6.22). The mean CD-RISC-25 score (60.75) was lower than reported scores for the general population (79.0). The mean PHQ-9 score (6.5) reflected mild depression (score range 5-9) and the mean GAD-7 score (6.9) reflected mild anxiety (score range 5-9). The mean NVS scores (Patients=2.25, Parents=2.7) revealed lower health literacy compared to the general population (3.4). The mean SBS-QoL score (63.4) was lower than scores reported for the general SBS population (72.58). The mean FaMM score (Condition Management Effort=13.5, Family Life Difficulty=36.1) indicated more time and work expended and slightly more difficulty in managing the child's SBS. In the qualitative survey, AYAs reported struggling with independence, difficulty with self-management of their condition, and reluctance to leave their pediatric health care providers as barriers to HCT. They also reported a desire to learn more about their condition, anatomy, prior surgeries, medications, TPN, oral nutrition, self-management skills, and how SBS could affect them when they are older. Conclusion(s): AYAs with SBS have lower transition readiness, resilience, health literacy and SBS-QoL and increased risk of mental health disorders. Targeted educational and psychological interventions to facilitate an easier transition to adulthood are needed in this vulnerable population.

N2  - Introduction: Recent position statements from organizations like the Society for the Study of Celiac Disease underscore the importance of family- centered psychosocial support in optimizing self-management, reducing treatment burden, and minimizing emotional distress. However, to date there have been no empirically supported behavioral interventions for children with celiac disease (CD) and their parents. To address this need, we have developed the Gluten Free Resilience and Overall Wellness (GROW) Project, a telehealth-based behavioral intervention, designed to improve quality of life and self-management. The aim of the current study was to evaluate acceptability and feasibility of the GROW Project for teens with CD and their parents. Method(s): Teens (ages 12-16) with physician-confirmed CD and their parent (n=5 dyads) participated in a proof-of-concept trial to investigate intervention feasibility and acceptability. Participants attended six 1-hour live group sessions for teens and parents, respectively. Surveys and one-hour semi-structured interviews were administered at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 3-month follow-up (T2) to assess: (1) intervention acceptability; (2) teen and parent quality of life; and (3) teen self-management. Gluten immunogenic peptide (GIP) test kits were mailed to participants' homes and an e-mail was sent prompting them to complete the testing within an 18-hour window at T0, T1, and T2. Brief knowledge assessments and feedback surveys were completed after each session. Recruitment, retention, and intervention uptake as well as field notes regarding intervention administration were tracked by a research assistant throughout the study. The target for intervention uptake was defined a priori as 80% of participants to attending a minimum of 24 minutes/session and attending four out of five active skill-based sessions (excluding the final summary session). Result(s): Teen participants (age M(SD)=12.60(0.89); age of diagnosis M(SD)=9.22(3.59)) were female (100%) and non-Hispanic (80%). All caregivers were mothers with at least an undergraduate college education. Average attendance rates across the six group sessions were 96.67% (teens) and 93.33% (parents). Three of the 60 total sessions received were individual make-up sessions (5%; two parents and one teen). All participants met target intervention uptake criteria (attending four active sessions for at least 24 minutes). Data collection at T0 and T1 (surveys, interview, and GIP testing), as well as post-session surveys, were 100% completed. Additionally, 100% of T0 and 90% of T1 survey batteries were completed within two weeks of intervention start and end, respectively. At T1 and T2, 100% of GIP testing and interviews were completed within the target ranges (two weeks for interviews; 18 hours for GIP testing). T3 data collections is planned for July 2023. Participant satisfaction was high for the intervention: all teens and parents stated that they would recommend the GROW Project. Participants reported valuing the opportunity to develop new skills and meet people with shared experiences. Additionally, participants frequently mentioned that the program would be a great fit for newly diagnosed individuals. However, experiences with GIP testing were mixed: 60% reported distress when taking the tests, with concerns raised about potential positive results, dislike of sample collection, and time-sensitive testing procedures; yet, most participants reported relief from negative test results. Internal field notes from group sessions indicated that most participants were actively engaged during sessions (either through verbal discussion or through Jamboard). However, discussions tended to run longer than planned and certain skill-building activities were abbreviated due to time constraints. Minor technical issues arose due to transitions between media and internet connectivity issues. Conclusion(s): Findings from the proof-of-concept trial, particularly high retention, sufficient completion of the intervention, and high levels of satisfaction with the GROW Project, suggest high feasibility and acceptability. Intervention uptake was excellent, with all participants exceeding targets for attendance and engagement during sessions. This indicates that the GROW Project is promising for further evaluation in an upcoming randomized controlled trial (RCT). Further refinements will focus on reducing the volume of content delivered to participants in-session to facilitate active, discussion-based learning and engagement. Continued refinements to the intervention may include time management of open discussions and streamlining presentation of visual aids to enhance efficiency of in-session intervention administration. Further automation of emails, survey links, and text-based messages may also facilitate efficient intervention delivery for a larger-scale RCT.

N2  - Introduction: Procedures involving needles often elicit fear and distress from children and caregivers in medical settings (McMurtry et al., 2015). These experiences can impact health care utilization and contribute to needle phobia (Taddio et al., 2012). Research supports the efficacy of non-pharmacological strategies for needle-based procedures; however, there are barriers to implementation in clinical practice, including limited opportunity for staff education and training on these techniques (Ballard et al. 2018). This quality improvement (QI) project developed and disseminated interprofessional resources to nursing and clinical staff in an outpatient Gastroenterology clinic in order to assess impact on nurse comfort with needle-related events and, ultimately, support patient coping with procedures. Method(s): Pediatric GI clinical lead nurse and Pediatric GI Psychologists created a Key Driver Diagram and developed a handout for families describing evidence-based strategies for procedural anxiety for needle-based procedures occurring in the pediatric GI clinic (e.g., flu vaccine, hepatitis b vaccine). Baseline data were collected regarding nurse experiences and baseline skills for administering needles/vaccines to patients in clinic. Psychologists then conducted teaching sessions with nursing staff to review evidence-based strategies. Resources, including handouts and Buzzy Bee devices, were provided to clinic staff to coordinate with the beginning of flu vaccine season. Twelve weekly surveys were sent to assess nursing staff comfort with needle-related procedures and utilization of resources. Result(s): Before QI methods, nursing staff endorsed high comfort for managing patient (M = 84.29, 0-100 range with 100 representing the highest comfort) and caregiver (M = 82.86, 0-100 range with 100 representing the highest comfort) distress with needle-based procedures in clinic. Distraction (71%) and relaxation (43%) were the most commonly known and used strategies at baseline. Throughout QI efforts, nursing staff comfort with patient procedural anxiety increased up to 100% and surpassed the project's aim. Conclusion(s): Nursing staff reported increased comfort with managing patient procedural anxiety during needle-based procedures in an outpatient GI clinic setting following multidisciplinary QI interventions, even beyond our aim. Barriers to implementation of QI strategies with nursing staff were addressed throughout the process and can provide insight on scaling similar interventions. Interprofessional collaboration between nursing staff and psychology providers and use of QI methods can support patients, caregivers, and providers in coping with procedures like vaccines in an outpatient specialty clinic setting.

N2  - Background Insomnia affects many people with physical and mental health harms, and reduced quality of life. University students are of particular concern due to unique academic pressures, with insomnia prevalence estimated between 9.4% and 38.2%. However, relatively little is known about UK students and this current study aimed to explore their insomnia experiences and coping stratgies. Methods Utilising convenience and snowball sampling, a qualitative interview study recruited students from the University of Sheffield in 2022 via email and poster invitations. Online or in-person interviews were undertaken and recorded using Google meet or an encrypted digital audio recorder. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to examine the interview data involving; this used the recognised IPA stages which included initial notes, creating themes, tabling themes, identifying concepts and further tabulation and case selection. Results A total of sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted, resulting in themes relating to participants' insomnia beliefs, experiences and associated strategies to manage insomnia. Self rather than professional diagnosis was apparent, and although participants considered themselves to have experienced insomnia symptoms, this word was seldom used. Participants referred instead to sleep problems which were characterised by their variability and two categories of perceived causes emerged: firstly, enduring/predictable factors such as studying abroad and 'homesickness', accommodation conditions, health problems and seasonal weather, and secondly, unpredictable factors such as feeling anxious or unsafe, COVID pandemic and being active before bedtime. Insomnia had multiple perceived negative mental and physical consequences for participants including: low mood, tiredness, weakened immune system and dermatological problems. Strategies to manage insomnia varied but were typically selfdirected and included changes to behaviours and rountines, typically actively doing something to promote sleep through activity or interventions such as aromatherapy or distractions; more formal pharmacies/prescription medications were perceived negatively and only used occasionally, as were cognitive behaviour therapies. Participants frequently described positive involvement of others and sharing of their insomnia experiences. Conclusion This exploratory qualitative study suggests insomnia or problematic sleep among UK university students is a concern and is linked to various perceived causes and has multiple negative manifestations which impact on different aspects of students' lives; many self-motivated insomnia management strategies were apparent, with formal healthcare involvement being exceptional. This has implications for how students with sleep problems are supported during their academic study and provides unique insights which will be of value to those involved in student support such as academic and healthcare staff.

N2  - Background Despite the well-recognised harms of smoking following a cancer diagnosis, smoking rates remain high, with reported suboptimal uptake of smoking cessation (SC) services by cancer patients. This study explored cancer patient perspectives regarding SC. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 cancer patients (from lung, breast, cervical, head & neck & general oncology services) attending four specialist cancer hospitals in Ireland, who were current smokers or had quit at/after diagnosis of cancer. Interviews were completed both in person and virtually on Zoom/Webex due to changing Covid-19 restrictions (2021 to 2022). Thematic analysis was applied to interview transcripts. Extensive patient engagement and data saturation were study strengths, while study limitation was lower recruitment of cervical and lung cancer patients. Results Five themes emerged: (1) Striving but struggling to quit: patients described multiple unsuccessful attempts in the past to quit a lifelong smoking habit despite frequent quit advice from doctors which participants noted was often ignored by them; infrequent SC supports were noted. (2) Diagnosis a shock but a cue to action: a cancer diagnosis prompted an attitude change towards smoking and most patients described a willingness to stop smoking with many quitting following brief advice from healthcare professionals (HCPs); however, some noted increased smoking to cope with the stress of diagnosis. (3) HCPs non-judgemental, but support variable: after diagnosis, most patients received frequent non-judgemental quit advice from HCPs but with inconsistent depth, emphasis and planning. Nicotine replacement therapy and passive information on SC interventions/ services in the form of SC leaflets were the most common SC supports offered. Very few patients received a formal SC intervention with variable views on its effectiveness. (4) Facilitators and barriers to SC exist: facilitators included some self-help techniques which distracted from smoking, vaping, self-determination, family/HCP support, accountability to HCPs; barriers included smoking environment, lack of awareness and provision of SC supports. (5) SC is a marathon, not a sprint: Patients described their perspective regarding excellent SC support in terms of an effective SC pathway/service. The need for a multi-dimensional approach, early and frequent conversations including quit advice, proactive referrals to and sustained support of specialist SC service incorporating affordable pharmacological and tailored and empowering psychosocial interventions were suggested. Conclusion Cancer patients who smoke want interventions to help them quit smoking. Tailored comprehensive SC services should be integrated into cancer care to assist cancer patients who find it difficult to quit a lifelong smoking habit.

N2  - Background Local health protection systems play a crucial role in the prevention, management, and control of infectious diseases in England and were critical to the recent pandemic response. Despite this vital function, few studies have explored the lived experience of health protection practitioners managing COVID-19. This paper fills this gap by using a qualitative methodology to examine how COVID-19 shaped the work of health protection staff managing infectious diseases in England during the pandemic. Methods Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted between June 2021 and October 2022 with staff working in a variety of health protection roles across three socio-economically contrasting local authorities in England. Participants included: staff working in local authority public protection teams (n=7); Public Health England staff (n=6); local authority consultants in public health (n=5); and community infection prevention and control nurses (n=2). Data was analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis and we draw out three themes below. Results Our first theme demonstrates the huge amount of work created by COVID-19 and the massive disruption and stress for health protection staff working to control the pandemic. We show how one of the consequences of these workloads was that, over time, health protection responsibilities were shifted to staff with limited health protection expertise. Our second theme shows how COVID exposed the cracks in a health protection system stressed by reductions in funding in the years leading up to the pandemic. Injecting money into the COVID response did not make up for lost health protection expertise and virtually all non-COVID health protection infectious disease work stopped. Our final theme shows how COVID has enhanced the capability and capacity for work around infectious diseases. COVID has increased funding for, and raised the profile of, health protection work, created a common cause across local authorities and has driven collaborative working. Conclusion While our findings may not be representative of all local authorities in England, they call into question the state's preparedness for a public health emergency on this scale and suggest a lack of resilience within local health protection systems. The pandemic has also, however, created a 'window of opportunity' for health protection. The increases in capacity and capability built within heath protection systems during the pandemic, if coupled with sustained increases in central government funding, could be capitalised on to build resilience for managing infectious diseases, and prepare for future pandemics.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Numerous studies have associated high stress with the nursing profession, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although cognitive-behavioral or creative approaches have been employed by experts to teach self-care, these interventions rarely utilized a solid therapeutic framework, involving a clear experimental design. This study, therefore, attempted to develop a therapy-based workshop for stress management among nurses at a German health care site by employing the Embodiment-Projection-Role (EPR) paradigm and techniques derived from traditionally different approaches. Physical mobilization, art, storytelling and role play were chosen as expressive media for self-exploration of inner resources in a supportive peer milieu. Breathwork and guided imagery were also employed to inspire nurses to develop their coping repertoire. Data were collected from nine participants in a quasi-experimental pre-post study design. The study findings indicated a statistically significant decrease of current stress level and also, a significant improvement in negative emotions, immediately after the intervention. This study suggests that a therapeutic framework with a holistic approach of mental health might serve as an effective coping process to deal with job stress. This study, moreover, encourages researchers to shed light on the EPR processes and explore the long-term effects of the therapeutic paradigm on mental health.Copyright © 2023 The Authors

T1  - Treatment of the Frail Multiple Myeloma Patient: Personalized Care
T3  - Society of Hematologic Oncology 2023 Annual Meeting. Houston United States.
A1  - O'Donnell E. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) is currently an incurable hematologic malignancy. It represents 10 percent of all hematologic malignancies with an estimated 34,470 cases in 2022.1 Despite the varied biology, MM predominantly affects a relatively narrow age range with the majority of patients diagnosed between 65 to 74 years, with a median age at onset of 69 years.2 A third of patients are >=75 years at the time of diagnosis, making MM a disease of aging. While this disease can impact individuals of all ages, frail adults face unique challenges when it comes to managing MM. Frailty, characterized by diminished strength and reduced physiological reserve,3 can complicate the diagnosis, treatment, and overall care of these individuals. In this abstract, we will explore the specific issues faced by frail adults with MM and discuss the importance of tailored care strategies to improve their care and quality of life. Assessing Frailty In considering the approach to the frail patient, it is important to understand the distinctive aspects of frailty and how they interact with MM. Frailty is not a disease itself, but rather a state of vulnerability associated with aging and chronic illness.3 Frail individuals often experience a decline in physical function, such as muscle weakness, decreased mobility, and fatigue. These factors can have a significant impact on the ability to tolerate cancer treatments. Several comorbidity indexes have been developed such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), the Kaplan-Feinstein Index, and the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Comorbidity Index, with the former developed over 3 decades ago.4,5 These are broadly used and predict one-year mortality based on comorbid conditions. However, none were specifically designed for MM. The Myeloma Comorbidity Index (MCI) and later a revised version (R-MCI), were developed in recent years using a weighted risk factor assessment including renal and lung function, frailty, and age, with the option to add cytogenetics.6 In clinical practice a widely accepted tool is the IMWG frailty scoring system combining age, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) and CCI, and identifies 3 groups: fit, intermediate, and frail. Initially designed for use in clinical trials, IMWG frailty score has been externally validated and is an accepted standard in many practices6. Frailty scores can be used to guide upfront dose modifications of therapies for patients with the goal of mitigating side effects and promoting long-term tolerability. Frailty scores are now more frequently being incorporated into study design and previous studies, such as RVDlite,7 have demonstrated that upfront dose modifications for standard of care therapies can offer older patients highly active multi-drug combinations with a more limited side effect profile while maintaining comparable efficacy. Despite the fact that these tools can be used to reliably classify patients and predict the risk of treatment- and host-related morbidity and mortality, frailty assessments can be cumbersome and challenging to integrate into clinical practice. Ongoing efforts need to be made to standardize and simplify assessments so that they may be routinely included in the care of older MM patients. Psychosocial Support Maintaining quality of life and ease of treatment delivery are important considerations for all but particularly for older frail patients, especially as treatment patterns shift toward longer durations. Goals of therapy are an important discussion to have with patients with MM. Because MM is not currently curable, it is important to have a meaningful conversation with patients about the balance of maintaining disease control with optimizing quality of life. By treating a patient's MM, we hope to improve organ function and relieve pain and other disease-related symptoms. We want patients to remain active, functional, and able to pursue the professional or personal activities in life that make them happy and make life meaningful. When considering the frail patient, psychosocial support is equally important for frail adults with MM. Patients with MM diagnosis can experience significant emotional distress8, and frail individuals may experience increased levels of anxiety and depression.9 Providing psychological support, counseling services, and access to support groups can help address the emotional toll of the disease and enhance the patient's wellbeing and resilience particularly in the frail population. Frail adults with MM may also face heightened complications such as increased susceptibility to infections.10 Combined with frailty, the risk of infections and their potential severity are amplified, making it essential for healthcare providers to closely monitor and manage these individuals' health. Pain management is another crucial aspect of caring for frail adults with MM. Bone pain is a common symptom of MM. Frail individuals may have a reduced pain threshold and limited mobility, which can further complicate their ability to manage pain effectively.11 A comprehensive approach to pain management, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, is essential to alleviate suffering and enhance overall comfort for these patients. In terms of overall care, a multidisciplinary approach is essential for frail adults with MM. This involves collaboration among oncologists, geriatricians, nurses, physical therapists, and other healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive care tailored to the specific needs of frail patients. The care team should develop an individualized treatment plan that takes into account the patient's overall health, functional status, and treatment goals while minimizing the risk of complications. Conclusion Frail adults with MM face unique challenges in managing their disease. The interaction between frailty and MM complicates treatment decisions, increases susceptibility to infections, and amplifies the impact of side effects. To address these challenges, healthcare providers must adopt a personalized, multidisciplinary approach that considers the individual's frailty status, tailors treatment plans accordingly, and provides comprehensive support for pain management and psychosocial well-being. By taking a personalized approach, we can enhance the quality of life for frail adults with MM and improve overall outcomes.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose or Objective The aim of this analysis was to investigate the role of psycho-oncologist during radiotherapy (RT) and the role of teleconsult. Materials and Methods According to the own care management policy of our Department, all patients during RT were welcome to receive freely and charge-free an assessment regarding their cognitive, emotional and physical state and related psycho-oncological support during treatment. A set of screening tests that investigate emotional distress and patient's mood is administered, including: Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Distress Thermometer, Brief Cope, Impact of Event Scale-Revised. During RT, easy tools, such as Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques, were performed to manage stress, reducing physical symptoms, mood and sleep disturbances. These psycho-therapeutic approaches were developed in individual sessions and/or in small group sessions. after RT, patients could be followed by tele-consultation or phycological evaluation on site. Results Between June 2019 and December 2021, 2727 patients underwent to RT. Of these, 2290 (84%) accepted to participate in psycho-oncological support program receiving at least a first evaluation. Excluding patients treated with short RT course (1-5 fractions), the remaining 1145 cases (50%) were followed during RT course with structured psycho-oncological interviews for a median of 3 sessions (range 2-5). In this subgroup, the median RT fractions were 25 (range 15-33). The median age was 60 years (range 20-78). Female were 1671 (73%) and male 619 (27%). The most represented cancer type was breast with 852 cases (51%), followed by prostate 123 (20%), gynecology/GI (98 12%), H&N/lung (74 10%) and brain (50 7%). Of the patients followed, 114 cases were followed for psychological disorders by external specialists. All patients completed their treatment without delay reporting a reduction in RT anxiety during the interviews and a "feeling of welcome". 82 patients were followed after RT, 30 with on-site consult and 52 with tele-consult. the consultation via web (video call) were well tolerated and comfortable for patients. However for phycologists, the evaluation of body is more difficult. Conclusion The approach to the patient in a RT center should be multidisciplinary and the result of a growing collaboration between physicians, physicists, technicians, nurses and administrators, with the coordination of the psycho-oncologist, whose role cannot be omitted, as long as a cure can be offered that takes into consideration not only the patient (who is affected by cancer) but the person. The role of phycologists after active treatment is necessary for some patients and the possibility of teleconsultation is helpful for patients but it is important for phycologist to improve his-her know-how for teleevaluation. The person at the center of care, even when staying at home.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Introduction: Midwifery leadership is vital for improving maternal health outcomes, yet limited leadership training opportunities exist. This study evaluated acceptability and preliminary outcomes of Leadership Link, a scalable online learning program that aims to increase midwives' leadership competencies. Method(s): The program evaluation study enrolled early-career midwives (<10 years since certification) into an online leadership curriculum using the LinkedIn Learning platform. The curriculum consisted of 10 courses (approximately 11 hours) of self-paced, non-health care-specific leadership content supplemented with brief midwifery-specific introductions from midwifery leaders. A preprogram, postprogram, and follow-up study design was used to evaluate changes in 16 self-assessed leadership abilities, self-perception as a leader, and resilience. Data were also collected on the application of leadership skills acquired through, and career advancements attributed to, program participation. Result(s): A total of 186 individuals activated LinkedIn Learning accounts. Almost half (41.9%) completed the full curriculum. Satisfaction was high, with 83.3% of postprogram survey respondents reporting the program was "probably" or "definitely" worth the time invested. Seventy-six participants (40.9%) provided matched pre- and immediate postprogram survey data on at least some of the 16 self-assessed leadership abilities. All 16 abilities showed statistically significant increases in pre- to postprogram mean scores, ranging from 6.4% to 32.5%. Both self-perception as a leader and resilience scores significantly increased from baseline. More than 87% of postprogram and follow-up survey respondents reported having applied new or improved leadership abilities to at least a small degree. Fifty-eight percent of follow-up survey respondents reported at least one midwifery career advancement, of whom 43.6% attributed the advancement, at least in part, to Leadership Link. Discussion(s): The findings suggest that the online Leadership Link curriculum is acceptable and may be effective in improving midwives' leadership capacity, potentially enhancing career opportunities and engagement in system change.Copyright © 2023 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

N2  - Background: Adult children of chronically mentally ill parents are prone to behavioural, emotional, and psychological problems compared to children and teenagers in the general community. Purpose(s): To gain an understanding of adult children's experiences with a parent living with a chronic mental illness in Giyani, Limpopo Province, South Africa. Design and methods: A qualitative exploratory, descriptive research design was utilised. Ten purposefully sampled adult children with a parent living with a chronic mental illness participated in the study. Data were collected using in-depth phenomenological interviews. Data were analysed utilising Tesch's open-coding method. Result(s): Adult children experienced having a parent living with a chronic mental illness as a difficult and painful journey filled with confusion. The support and lack of support they received from people around them. They ultimately accepted their situation based on the realisation their parent has a chronic mental illness. Conclusion(s): Based on the findings, it is recommended that healthcare professionals should promote individuals' mental health and well-being through the provision of mental health education, facilitation of a reduction in mental health stigma in communities, and fostering resilience among adult children with a parent living with a chronic mental illness. The facilitation of support and acceptance of their parent's mental status is also vital for these individuals. Collaboration between families with parental mental illness, the community, social services, mental health services and other relevant organisations and stakeholders were highlighted in supporting these families to achieve better outcomes.Copyright © 2023

N2  - This study investigates the complex interrelationships between peer support, mental distress, self-care abilities, health perceptions, and daily life activities among cancer patients and survivors while considering the evolving nature of these experiences over time. A cross-sectional survey design is employed, utilizing de-identified data from the National Cancer Institute's 2022 nationally representative dataset, which comprises responses from 1234 participants, including 134 newly diagnosed patients undergoing cancer treatment. Partial least squares structural equation modeling is employed for data analysis. The results reveal that peer support significantly reduces mental distress and positively influences the perception of self-care abilities and health perceptions among cancer patients and survivors. Additionally, the study finds that mental distress negatively affects daily life activities and self-care abilities. This means that when cancer patients and survivors experience high levels of mental distress, they may struggle with everyday tasks and find it challenging to care for themselves effectively. The research also shows that mental distress tends to decrease as time passes since diagnosis and health perceptions improve, highlighting the resilience of cancer patients and survivors over time. Furthermore, the study uncovers significant moderating effects of age, education, and income on the relationships between daily life activity difficulties, perception of self-care ability, and perception of health. In conclusion, this research provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate associations between the variables of interest among cancer patients and survivors. The findings underscore the importance of peer support and targeted interventions for promoting well-being, resilience, and quality of life in this population, offering valuable insights for healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers. Identifying moderating effects further emphasizes the need to consider individual differences when designing and implementing support systems and interventions tailored to the unique needs of cancer patients and survivors.Copyright: © 2023 Shahsavar, Choudhury.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Prior studies of psychological responses in patients who have undergone pregnancy termination for fetal or genetic indications have shown that grief symptoms subside over time; however, many of these studies have been limited to the acute period following termination without measurement of grief response beyond one year. We aimed to describe and understand the subjective experiences and long-term support needs for individuals who had contemplated the prospect of becoming pregnant again or navigated a subsequent pregnancy in the 1-5 years after pregnancy termination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted 23 interviews with patients who had undergone after prenatal diagnosis of a fetal or genetic condition. We invited participants to interviewif they were 1-5 years remote from their pregnancy termination. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used a combination of deductive and inductive approaches to develop a codebook that captured all relevant themes. We utilized NVIVO software to conduct content and thematic analysis. RESULT(S): We reached thematic saturation at 23 interviews.Seventeen of 23 participants had a subsequent pregnancy in the 1-5 years that had elapsed after pregnancy termination, with thirteen of those resulting in a live birth. Two participants were pregnant at the time of the study interview. Participants described subsequent pregnancies that were fraught with anxiety and uncertainty, with some feeling that healthcare providers did not adequately acknowledge their pregnancy history or fully understand how it should inform the care for their subsequent pregnancies. Participants expressed a desire for their obstetric providers to directly address their prior loss when planning care for their subsequent pregnancy. They reported feeling as though providers fell short in addressing their concerns related to their experience of grief and bereavement. Participants felt greater reassurance when their subsequent pregnancies were treated as high-risk and monitored more closely with genetic testing and additional ultrasounds. However, participants described that prenatal genetic and ultrasound testing was not adequately reassuring without provider explanations on how these tests pertained to their prior histories. CONCLUSION(S): Individuals who had undergone pregnancy termination for fetal or genetic indications expressed a desire for care around subsequent pregnancies that was sensitive to and informed by their prior loss. Participants' suggestions highlight the importance of provider counseling and acknowledging and prioritizing the prior loss as a key concern in subsequent care. IMPACT STATEMENT: This study sheds light on patients' unique experiences of bereavement and coping in the 1-5 years after pregnancy termination for fetal/genetic indications, and emphasizes the need to acknowledge and prioritize their prior losses. Care during subsequent pregnancies represents a critical opportunity to provide longitudinal support to patients with complex grief and bereavement needs.Copyright © 2023

T1  - Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management (Health EDRM): WHO initiative to promote global collaboration to improve research and evidence
T3  - 22nd International Congress of Nutrition, IUNS. Tokyo Japan.
A1  - Kayano R. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - World Health Organization (WHO) has taken initiatives to develop and support the implementation of health emergency and disaster risk management (Health EDRM) by countries and support the implementation of country strategies, the Sendai Framework, International Health Regulations (2005), the Sustainable Development Goals (2015), and Paris Agreement on Climate Change (2016) and other related regional and global frameworks. The Health EDRM Framework, published by WHO in 2019, describes all the functions that are required across multiple disciplines in health and other sectors that reduce hazards, vulnerabilities, and exposures, while ensuring effective preparedness and readiness, response, and recovery to save lives, protect health and build community and country resilience. Evidence and research play vital roles in advancing all aspects of Health EDRM including understanding community risks, informing the design and delivery of health and related services, health workforce development and monitoring and evaluation. In order to improve the scientific evidence for Health EDRM and promote global and regional collaboration among researchers and experts, WHO established the WHO Thematic Platform for Health EDRM Research Network (Health EDRM RN) in 2018. The Health EDRM RN has supported the setting of key research themes which has informed WHO Health EDRM research funding over the past 3 years, and the publication of the WHO Guidance on Research Methods for Health EDRM in 2021, which was developed through the collaboration among over 100 global experts. In the context of identifying and applying the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and other emergencies and disasters, the Health EDRM RN will continue to strengthen multidisciplinary including nutritional science and multi-sectoral collaboration, Health EDRM research capacities and translating the evidence base into policy and practice. In view of the progress made by the Health EDRM RN and the shifting global situation, two major projects are underway: the 2nd phase of the WHO Health EDRM Knowledge Hub the elaboration of research priorities for Health EDRM. The opportunity to provide wider understanding of the WHO Health EDRM policy, practice and several advanced research areas is important for disaster risk management. The WHO Health EDRM Research Network provides effective multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral collaboration for engagement in development of policy, practice and research. An opportunity to join the Research Network is shared.

N2  - Background: Awareness regarding coping with sick days among patients with diabetes is limited. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of sick-day education by community pharmacists among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using sick-day educational materials (sick-day cards). Method(s): A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted. Pharmacists in the intervention group educated patients with T2D on coping with sick days (adjusting medication dosage and seeking medical advice) using sick-day cards compared with the usual counseling. Differences in questionnaire scores ("Anxiety", "Intention", "Attitude", and "Knowledge" about sick days) before and after the intervention were compared between the groups. Result(s): Overall, 318 patients with T2D (intervention, 119; control, 199) participated in this study, and 270 (intervention, 92; control, 178) patients were examined. There were no significant differences in "Anxiety", "Intention", or "Attitude" scores between the two groups, but "Knowledge" scores improved in the intervention group. For all intervention groups (92/92), a physician reviewed and approved medication and adjustment doses for sick days on the cards. Conclusion(s): According to patients' responses, sick-day education using teaching materials improved patient knowledge. This may help patients and their caregivers cope with sick days appropriately through medication dose adjustment and fluid intake.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Central to Safety-II is promoting resilience of healthcare practices. In the "Room for Resilience" research project we focus on the role of horizontal and vertical accountability in healthcare teams and aim to discover how the relation between the two impacts team reflections and discussions. In this article, we report on an explorative study at the start of the project which aimed to assess the structures and dynamics of horizontal and vertical accountability. METHOD(S): A qualitative study in six teams in three hospitals in the Netherlands. For the project, each team selected a specific clinical process to work on (e.g. pain assessment). We interviewed healthcare professionals, managers, and quality advisors about these processes, how they are discussed in practice and how teams need to account for them. Additionally, we observed the processes and how teams discuss them in practice. In total, we conducted 35 interviews and 67.5 h of observation. Transcripts and field notes were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULT(S): Professionals at times varied in what they considered the right approach in the clinical process, with differing views on the importance of certain actions. When processes were discussed, this mostly was done during clinical work, and it often concerned reflections about the care for a specific patient instead of reflecting on the team's general approach of the clinical process. Organized reflections on the processes were sparse. How processes were conducted in practice deviated from guidelines, mainly due to staff shortages, a perceived lack of value of a guideline, equipment issues, and collaboration issues. For most processes, accountability to hierarchical layers consisted of quality indicator scores. Professionals were tasked with registering indicator data but did not find this meaningful for their work. CONCLUSION(S): The observed different perspectives within teams on what good quality care is show the importance of having team reflections about these processes. How vertical accountability was organized at times impacted the conditions for teams to discuss resilient performance. Following these findings, we recommend that reflection on resilient practice and the role of accountability processes is organized on all levels in (and outside) the organization.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nursing education's positioning within higher education mandated public nursing education institutions to develop competent nurses to manage diverse disease profiles of the country. Nurse educators were tasked to develop a competency-based curriculum with emphasis on primary healthcare to help prepare nurses to be independent, leaders, researchers, and critical thinkers. OBJECTIVE(S): To explore and describe the challenges experienced by nurse educators in Gauteng when developing the curriculum for the postgraduate nursing diploma programmes. METHOD(S): An exploratory descriptive qualitative research design was used. Purposive sampling was followed to select the participants based on the inclusion criteria. Four focus group interviews were conducted, comprising of six participants each, leading to a sample of 30. Data collection were between March 2022 and April 2022. Thematic data analysis were performed following Tesch's eight steps of analysis. RESULT(S): Themes that emerged during data analysis were psychological and emotional impact, challenges with communication and interpersonal relations, nurse educators experienced transformation and empowerment, nurse educators encountered barriers that impacted on their allocated tasks, and, nurse educators demonstrated resilience with the curriculum development processes. CONCLUSION(S): Participants reported positive and negative experiences they encountered during curriculum development. The findings revealed that nurse educators need support when involved in curriculum development, for instance, managerial, administrative, technological, financial, and most importantly capacitation, as this could enable them to work effectively without deterrents.Contribution: This study highlights the need to train and support nurse educators when developing a curriculum to equip them with the necessary competencies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated wide-ranging adaptations to the organisation of health systems, and primary care is no exception. This article aims to collate insights on the role of primary care during the pandemic. The gained knowledge helps to increase pandemic preparedness and resilience. METHOD(S): The role of primary care during the pandemic in five European countries (Austria, Denmark, France, Hungary, Italy) was investigated using a qualitative approach, namely case study, based on document analysis and semi-structured interviews. In total, 31 interviews were conducted with primary care providers between June and August 2022. The five country case studies were subjected to an overarching analysis focusing on successful strategies as well as gaps and failures regarding pandemic management in primary care. RESULT(S): Primary care providers identified disruptions to service delivery as a major challenge emerging from the pandemic which led to a widespread adoption of telehealth. Despite the rapid increase in telehealth usage and efforts of primary care providers to organise face-to-face care delivery in a safe way, some patient groups were particularly affected by disruptions in service delivery. Moreover, primary care providers perceived a substantial propagation of misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines among the population, which also threatened patient-physician relationships. At the same time, primary care providers faced an increased workload, had to work with insufficient personal protective equipment and were provided incongruous guidelines from public authorities. There was a consensus among primary care providers that they were mostly sidelined by public health policy in the context of pandemic management. Primary care providers tackled these problems through a diverse set of measures including home visits, implementing infection control measures, refurbishing used masks, holding internal meetings and relying on their own experiences as well as information shared by colleagues. CONCLUSION(S): Primary care providers were neither well prepared nor the focus of initial policy making. However, they implemented creative solutions to the problems they faced and applying the learnings from the pandemic could help in increasing the resilience of primary care. Attributes of an integrated health system with a strong primary care component proved beneficial in addressing immediate effects of the pandemic.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - Background Although it is known that resilience is negatively associated with burnout, and that certain interventions can effectively increase resilience, little is known about online resilience-enhancing interventions during the COVID-19 crisis. The aim of this study was to identify the association between an online resilience-enhancing intervention and workplace social support, and burnout among nurses working in the mainland and remote islands of Japan during the COVID-19 crisis. Methods Pretest-posttest was conducted between April 2020 and February 2021, and the questionnaire survey included the bidimensional resilience scale, the Japanese version of Pine's Burnout Measure, and the workplace social support scale. Changes in burnout, resilience, and social support and the associations with nursing discussions as intervention were analyzed. Participants were 98 Nurses with 1 to 10 years of experience from Japan's mainland and remote island hospitals of Kagoshima Prefecture participated in a baseline survey in April 2020. Of these, 76 participated in a secondary survey in September 2020, and 69 participated in the intervention program and a third survey in February 2021. The online intervention over Zoom consisted of small-group nursing discussions based on the broaden-and-build theory. Results Changes in burnout showed a significant negative association with change in workplace social support (Coef. = -0.019, 95% CI -0.035- -0.003), as did the interaction between change in acquired resilience and intervention (Coef. = -0.088, 95% CI -0.164- -0.011). Conclusion Change in workplace social support was significantly negatively associated with changes in burnout, as was the interaction of intervention and acquired resilience. Promotion of this intervention and making workplace social support more accessible may contribute to reduce burnout in nurses.Copyright © 2023 Tottori University Medical Press.

N2  - Despite the challenges facing Indigenous youth and their communities due to historical and contemporary institutionalised racism in Canada, communities are drawing on the richness of their own histories to reassert their cultural heritage. Doing so supports mental health outcomes of young people in particular, as highlighted in a compelling body of research. The question facing many communities, however, is how they can facilitate such child and youth engagement in order to support related positive mental health outcomes. This article reports on findings from a Participatory Action Research (PAR) study conducted in a First Nations community in Unama'ki (Cape Breton), Atlantic Canada. The study, Spaces & Places, was a partnership between the community-based mental health service provider (Eskasoni Mental Health Services, EMHS), eight community youth (14-18 years old), and a team of academics. Situated within a resilience framework, the team explored the ways in which the community facilitated, or restricted, youth civic and cultural engagement. Foregrounded against a strong legacy of cultural reassertion within the community, findings highlight the core resilience-promoting resources that support positive youth development. Additionally, findings demonstrate how these resources provide meaningful support for youth because of the way in which they are intertwined with one another. Furthermore, cultural engagement is underpinned by the Two-eyed Seeing model, supporting youth to integrate their own culture with settler culture in ways that work best for them. Findings support community-based service structures, and underscore the importance of community resilience in the effective support of Indigenous children and youth.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate current levels of and factors contributing toward burnout and resiliency among new graduate nurses to identify effective mitigation strategies. BACKGROUND: New graduate nurses are at a high risk of increased turnover in the 1st year of employment. An evidence-based, graduate-nurse centered approach is essential to improving nurse retention among this cohort. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study involving 43 new graduate nurses was completed in July 2021 (a subset of a larger sample of 390 staff nurses). Nurses were recruited to complete the Brief Resilience Scale, the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, and a demographic survey. RESULT(S): New graduate nurses scored within "normal resiliency." This cohort reported moderate levels of burnout overall. Higher levels were reported within personal- and work-related subgroups. CONCLUSION(S): Strategies to reduce burnout and increase resiliency in new graduate nurses should be focused on improving personal and work-related burnout.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Nurses in surgical-trauma units are susceptible to compassion fatigue due to work-related stressors. Mitigating and preventing compassion fatigue are critical to supporting the health and well-being of surgical-trauma nurses. LOCAL PROBLEM: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a surgical-trauma unit was converted to a designated COVID-19 unit. Nurses verbalized feelings of burnout and stress during the pandemic and did not have a mechanism to cope with work-related stress. This project evaluated the impact of brief mindfulness-based interventions on compassion fatigue. METHOD(S): From February 2021 to March 2022, mindfulness champions led 5 minutes of mindfulness-based interventions, including meditation, deep breathing, and self-compassion exercises, during shift huddles. The Professional Quality of Life, version 5, questionnaire was used to evaluate preintervention and postintervention burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and compassion satisfaction. Paired-sample t tests were used to evaluate the results. RESULT(S): Twenty-nine of 34 nurses responded (85% response rate) with matched preintervention and postintervention questionnaires. All subscale scores showed significant improvement after intervention. The mean burnout subscale score decreased by 9.35% (P = .003), mean secondary traumatic stress subscale score decreased by 11.89% (P = .005), and mean compassion satisfaction subscale score increased by 6.44% (P = .03) after intervention. DISCUSSION: After implementing brief mindfulness-based interventions in shift huddles, nurses reported reductions in elements of compassion fatigue (burnout and secondary traumatic stress). Nurses reported that adding brief mindfulness-based interventions to shift huddles helped them cope with work-related stress. CONCLUSION(S): Brief mindfulness-based interventions can improve nurses' compassion satisfaction while reducing compassion fatigue measurements.Copyright ©2023 American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.

N2  - Background Heart failure (HF) continues to be a global health problem with its ramifications more pronounced in underdeveloped countries. Family members play a pivotal part in patient management which may influence the patient's overall quality of life. Prolonged delay in attendance to health care facilities among patients indicates ineffective support from family caregivers. In the Tanzanian context, there is limited information about the experiences of family caregivers in caring for patients with HF. This study explored family caregivers' experiences in caring for HF patients. Methods A qualitative descriptive study design was conducted at Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. A purposive sampling technique was used to select the potential participants. A sample size of 10 family caregivers of patients with HF was included in the study. Thematic analysis was used to derive the main theme and sub-themes. Results Three major themes were identified: demands for supportive care, new caring role and lifestyle, and professional support in caring for patients with HF. Caregivers needed social and financial support to facilitate the caring process. Learning to provide the required care at the right time was the new role acquired by caregivers while failing to participate in social events and caregiving in an unfavourable environment were reported as challenges in caregiving. However, compliance with instruction and effective interaction among the nurses and caregivers were considered to be positive professional support. Conclusion Caregivers need social and financial support to provide effective care to their patients. Caregiving is a learning process that needs continuous educational support to adapt to the new caring roles and challenges. Nurses should conduct regular assessments to explore caregivers' needs, challenges, and concerns and provide timely counselling that can facilitate coping.Copyright: © 2023 Mcharo et al.

N2  - Background Against the background of missing culturally sensitive mental health care services for refugees, we developed a group intervention (Empowerment) for refugees at level 3 within the stratified Stepped and Collaborative Care Model of the project Mental Health in Refugees and Asylum Seekers (MEHIRA). We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the Empowerment group intervention with its focus on psychoeducation, stress management, and emotion regulation strategies in a culturally sensitive context for refugees with affective disorders compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU). Method At level 3 of the MEHIRA project, 149 refugees and asylum seekers with clinically relevant depressive symptoms were randomized to the Empowerment group intervention or TAU. Treatment comprised 16 therapy sessions conducted over 12 weeks. Effects were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Further scales included assessed emotional distress, self-efficacy, resilience, and quality of life. Results Intention-to-treat analyses show significant cross-level interactions on both self-rated depressive symptoms (PHQ-9; F (1,147) = 13.32, p < 0.001) and clinician-rated depressive symptoms (MADRS; F (1,147) = 6.91, p = 0.01), indicating an improvement in depressive symptoms from baseline to post-intervention in the treatment group compared to the control group. The effect sizes for both scales were moderate (d = 0.68, 95% CI 0.21-1.15 for PHQ-9 and d = 0.51, 95% CI 0.04-0.99 for MADRS). Conclusion In the MEHIRA project comparing an SCCM approach versus TAU, the Empowerment group intervention at level 3 showed effectiveness for refugees with moderately severe depressive symptoms.Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

N2  - It is a prevalent misconception that healthcare professionals are specialists and thus can effectively manage their health. This is probably true, but given recent pandemics and the rise in violence in medical settings, one is compelled to question whether their health and safety are sufficient for a robust healthcare system. This is important because protecting and promoting the health, safety, and well-being of health workers will improve the quality of patient care and increase the resilience of health services in the face of outbreaks and public health emergencies. We thus strive to answer this question and suggest potential remedies to this growing public health issue.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: EULAR has recently highlighted the vital role of digital health in standard practice and the possibility to enhance the patient's quality of life. Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) plays an important role in improving clinical outcomes in inflammatory arthritis patients. The aim of CBT is to boost patients' self-efficacy for pain management, or their confidence in their ability to control their pain, and lessen the interference that pain causes in their everyday lives. CBT does this by educating patients on how to develop more efficient coping mechanisms to deal with everyday pain sensations and enhance functionality and quality of life. So far, no comprehensive mobile app has been developed to facilitate the collaboration between patients and their CBT therapist, especially with those having monetary and physical constraints related to their disease. Objective(s): 1-To provide basic data on system requirement specifications for a mobile app to provide constructed CBT program for RA patients 2. Identify the target audience, characteristics of the app, and correlations between the system requirements and the established CBT. Method(s): To identify the major themes recognised as the main pillars for app development and inform the app developer/machine learning engineer, a participatory action research design was implemented. Qualitative data were collected using multiple methods in four workshops. Participants were 2 Rheumatologists, 1 rheumatology nurse specialist, 1 Psychiatrist4 rheumatoid arthritis patient, and an App developer. A taxonomy was used to determine the degree of correlation between the system requirements and established cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. Result(s): The app targets the optimization of patient-reported outcomes and quality of life to provide a non-medical management approach via modifying Disease-specific dysfunctional beliefs and behaviors using cognitive and/or behavioral exercises in a structured manner. The major themes identified were: 1. collect self-completed patient-reported outcomes (disease functional ability, quality of life, motivation), 2. Collect information on patient demographics, comorbidity(ies), disease activity status (self-reported disease activity score), plus past and current medications, 3. Identify the individual patient's target to be achieved, 4. Develop a patient profile that focuses on the patient's perpetuating factors, 5. construction of a personalized, evidence-based disease management program based on recommendations from medical guidelines, medical standards, and state-of-the-art clinical research; 6. implementation of a personalized CBT program for Effective Coping, Life Goals, Pain Management, Emotional Responses, Managing Change, Self-Esteem, Relationships 7. a calendar feature for goal setting, planning, and recording of physical activity performance and progress, 8. a small community feature for positive feedback, support from peers and support the patient in coping with stress, sadness, depression, pain, fatigue, and further disease-related symptoms, 9. Implementation of relaxation exercises, 10. adapt a reward system to motivate end users for using the app,11. to help the patients learn ways to cope with increased resilience to disease-related episodes.12. Format the app interface. Conclusion(s): These findings highlight the potential of implementing digital CBT to encourage RA patients to be able to cope with their disease, change wrong beliefs, allow them to retain jobs, socialize normally, and engage with healthcare professionals. The results of this work suggest that using an app-based personalized disease management program may reflect significantly on several measures of patient-reported outcomes and disease quality of life in RA considering alleviating conventional physical CBT barriers. Future feasibility testing in a prospective study will firmly establish the reliability, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of such an app intervention for this cohort of RA patients.

N2  - Background: EULAR has recently highlighted the vital role of digital health in standard practice and the possibility to enhance the self-management abilities of the patients. Self-management strategies play an important role in improving clinical outcomes in patients with inflammatory arthritis. Smartphone technology has the potential to engage the patients with their treating health care professionals through suitable self-monitoring and easy access to information. In addition, having a more accurate summary of self-reported fluctuations in symptoms, psychosocial problems and behaviors can help both the patients and the treating health care professionals better understand the patient's condition, identify barriers to self-management, and assess treatment effectiveness and additional health care needs. However, evidence regarding these supporting digital tools, including smartphone apps, is currently very limited. So far there is no comprehensive mobile app developed to facilitate the collaboration between the patients and their treating physicians. Objective(s): 1.To provide basic data on system requirement specifications for a mobile app to self-manage inflammatory arthritis. 2. Identify the target audience, characteristics of the app, and correlations between the system requirements and the established behavior change techniques. Method(s): A participatory action research design was adopted to inform the app developer of the major themes recognized as the main pillars for the app development, implementing artificial intelligence. Qualitative data were collected using multiple methods in several workshops. Participants were 2 Rheumatologists, 1 rheumatology nurse specialist, 1 rheumatoid arthritis patient, 1 psoriatic arthritis patient, 1 patient Ankylosing spondylitis, and an App/ machine learning engineer.

Using artificial intelligence, construction of a personalized, evidence-based disease self-management program based on recommendations from medical guidelines, medical standards, and state-of-the-art clinical research; 6. implementation of personalized recommendations into the patient's daily life by providing short daily tasks that accelerate positive behavior change. 7. a calendar feature for goal setting, planning, and recording of (HRQoL) performance and progress, 8. a small community feature for positive feedback, support from peers and support the patient in coping with stress, sadness, depression, fatigue, and further disease-related symptoms, 9. Implementation of cognitive behavioral techniques, meditation and relaxation methods, 10. adapt a reward system to motivate end users for using the app, and, 11. Format the app interface. Conclusion(s): These findings highlight the potential of implementing digital therapy to encourage self-management and engagement with health care professional for the management of patients with inflammatory arthritis.

N2  - Background: The Inflammatory Arthritis (IA) patient population is growing, whilst there already is a shortage of health care professionals (HCPs). It is impossible to meet the future demand for care with the current healthcare system. Digital biomarkers are objective, quantifiable, physiological and behavioural data that are collected and measured by means of digital devices [1]. They can support continuous measurements outside the physical confines of the clinical environment and so could help close the gap in healthcare demands Objectives: To obtain the patients' insights on disease activity, disease management and care needs; and to empathise with their attitude towards digital biomarkers in order to obtain future directions for digital biomarker development Methods: A Design Thinking approach is followed for the development of digital biomarkers in rheumatology. It is a human-centered problem-solving approach that leverages empathy and collective idea generation to tackle complex challenges [2]. Semi-structured focus group discussions, based on the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation [3], were conducted through 60-minute video conferences. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed to verbatim and coded. Results were discussed with our patient partners Results: In total 6 focus groups were organised, with a total of 30 IA patients (22 PsA; 8 RA, age 51+/- 11 years, 48% male, time since diagnosis 7 (3:12,5) years) The main findings were: Trial and error; life after diagnosis is marked by trial and error. They need(ed) to learn how and when to listen to their bodies, uncover potential triggers of inflammation and develop appropriate disease management They felt an urgency to get advice on lifestyle adjustments, career choices and life adaptations, and discuss these with their HCPs and fellow patients. Role of the HCPs in care needs; patients visited their HCP for affirmation, reflection and future directions. They often doubted whether their symptoms were rheumatic Secondly, they wanted to be ensured adverse drug reactions are absent, blood tests brought them peace of mind. Furthermore, consultations were indicated as an obligatory moment of self-reflection. Conversing with their HCP was seen as a reality check and a conversation about (new) options. Digital Biomarkers; attitudes towards digital biomarkers varied. Some patients thought it could provide them with deeper insights and reminders before crossing a line. Some patients thought it relevant only for their HCP. They did not want a constant reminder of their disease. Others did not see any additional value as they knew themselves well enough that no device should tell them whether their feelings are true or not Conclusion(s): The following problem statement from the patients' perspective can be formulated; we suffer from a disease that has turned our lives upside down, we have to cope with it every day. Our learning mechanism is by trial and error. We have to know which activities should be avoided and how to predict the seriousness of a flare. It is difficult to discriminate pain as just pain, from pain as a preceding symptom of flare. The affirmation from our HCPs and our blood results bring us peace of mind. Perhaps, by applying technology, we can speed up our learning process and triggers of flare could be identified. However, one should be mindful of the purpose, the amount of reminders it gives us and the visualisation of our measurements. In general there is no strong resistance to digital biomarkers. However, for future uptake the recorded data should be of clear benefit for the patient.

Based on the framework for complex interventions [1], we developed a self-management intervention (INSELMA)[2]. Based on shared decision-making, which included an initial assessment and a goal setting process a rheumatology nurse coordinated interdisciplinary support and available offers in primary care to achieve the patients' individual goals. A feasibility test of the six-month intervention encompassed 19 patients with IA and substantial impact of the disease. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to explore the participants' experience of feasibility, acceptability, and potential benefit from participation in the INSELMA intervention. Method(s): Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants in INSELMA. Thematic analysis was applied [3]. Result(s): Fifteen participants were interviewed (9 women, 6 men, aged 44-75, 17-75 min.). The participants associated the benefits they experienced from the intervention to the impact IA had on their everyday lives. The analysis derived four overall themes. 1) A new opportunity. Participation in INSELMA was experienced as an opportunity to improve, reduce challenges, or change issues they felt they had fought alone until now. Some expressed worries that their situation was too complex to be able to contribute to the study and some participated to contribute to scientific IA evidence. 2) The importance of person-centred goals. The individual goals encompassed both physical, social, and emotional life skills. When expectations and goals were aligned, it facilitated a positive outcome. The empathic support and coaching from the nurses, who listened, motivated, and understood their problems were considered especially valuable. Time between consultations to work with goals at home was pointed out as important to experience progress. 3) A little nudging means everything. Several participants expressed that the intervention had contributed with new or refreshed knowledge and motivation to change habits. Some would like continued follow-up with the nurse after the end of the study to stay committed. Also some suggested that this type of intervention should be a general offer for all patients with IA. Having access to a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist with rheumatology experience for exercise support adapted to the participants' needs and abilities was especially important for them. 4) I got more than I wished for. The intervention was experienced as feasible and meaningful, and the overall impression was positive. Several cried tears of joy and gratitude as they experienced decreased symptom load, improvement in physical strength, mobility, and sleep as well as increased energy and coping. Two had experienced no change, of which one had resumed physical activity after several years. The participants expressed hope for the future as they had new tools and habits to prevent problems and manage symptoms, which resulted in motivation to work towards new goals. Conclusion(s): Patients found the INSELMA intervention feasible. They experienced decreased disease impact and increased activity level, facilitated by empathy and self-management support from the health professionals.

N2  - Background: When someone is first diagnosed, he/she is faced with a number of feelings and changes in their life. Such feelings are usually shock, anger, sadness fear, the feeling of being judged, the feeling of a sense of loss of control Usually, the supportive environment like family members, friends and colleagues cannot understand exactly how the person feels unless they have received a rheumatic diagnosis themselves. Doctors and health professionals may sometimes offer minor emotional support, but their primary focus is always medical This may cause feelings of loneliness, misunderstanding or isolation. And here is where the role of support groups finds its place OBJECTIVES: Methods: The general coordination of the Groups is done by the Vice President of CYLPER and the Psychosocial Support Officer, in collaboration with the Social Officer of CYLPER. Members of each Group can become Registered Rheumatism Members of CYLPER. The coordination of the operation of each Group is done by the coordinator who is elected by the members of the committee. The GPSD will be responsible for organising their events through their volunteers, and for this purpose an amount will be approved that will be available to the team to carry out its work Results: Finding a support group is a way for people with rheumatism to interact with other people who have similar, first-hand experiences with rheumatism People can talk about their experiences and share their own. This can help reduce stress. In a support group, members can feel more comfortable sharing feelings and experiences that may be too difficult or too awkward to share with their family and friends. Being part of a group often creates a sense of belonging that helps each person feel more understood and less isolated. They can also discuss practical information in a support group such as: What to expect during treatment; How to manage specific side effects; How to find support services; How to communicate with health care providers and family members. Talking about these topics within the support group could provide a sense of control and reduce feelings of helplessness. Many studies have shown that support groups help people with a chronic disease cope with anxiety and depression Conclusion(s): Running a support group is a good way to reach out and get people interested in the other things your organisation or initiative does. With relatively little effort and cost, a support group can make a significant impact in the lives of people dealing with a problem.

N2  - Background: Systemic inflammatory rheumatic diseases are characterized by being chronic diseases. These diseases affect the person, in their various dimensions and are often associated with pain, loss of mobility and function, fatigue, anxiety and depression (Matcham, Norton, Scott, Steer & Hotopf, 2016; Primdhal & Esbensen, 2020; Ryan, 2020). The complex needs of these patients require and benefit of an advanced nursing practice and a guided and specialized attention that can be provided in a nursing clinic. The awareness of rheumatic patient needs and lack of this type of care led, to our knowledge, to the development of the first rheumatology nurse clinic in Portugal. Objective(s): Characterize a guided nursing clinic with the aim to support patients with systemic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, mainly initiating subcutaneous (sc) classic and biological DMARDs. Method(s): Summarized description of first guided rheumatology nurse clinic in Portugal. Result(s): This nurse clinic was created and developed during the pandemic period of SARS-CoV 2 (starting February 2020). For the last three years a total of 556 appointments was performed. The targeted patients had systemic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, mainly rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and spondylarthritis treated with sc classic and biological DMARDs. Appointments are scheduled at week 0 and 4 of starting these therapeutics and also whenever needed, at the request of the patient or the treating physician, in order to ensure a good nurse availability to clarify doubts at the beginning of these treatments. In the specific case of sc methotrexate, a protocol was created by the Rheumatology multidisciplinary team, defining the parameters eligible for evaluation, and the respective procedures of care. During appointments nurses also assess specific disease implications in the person's daily life, both physical, emotional and social domains. Additionally, this is an opportunity to reinforce reliable information on disease management, coping strategies, including information how to manage medication side effects. Conclusion(s): The rheumatology nursing outpatient clinic provides key additional care and monitorization to patients with systemic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, treated with sc classic and biological DMARDs. Nurses improve the management of chronic diseases, namely by promoting autonomy of the patient in self-administration of sc therapies at home, counselling and informing about possible adverse effects and respective management strategies, constituting a valid contribution to disease control and patient engagement and education.

N2  - SESSION TITLE: Nurturing Growth: Fostering Success in Trainees SESSION TYPE: Original Investigations PRESENTED ON: 10/10/2023 01:45 pm - 02:45 pm PURPOSE: Physician residents during the COVID-19 pandemic witnessed immense amounts of death and morbidity. During the peak of the Omicron surge, ICU residents at Ascension St. Vincent's Indianapolis Hospital had as many as four comfort care planning discussions per day with family members, leading to over 50% of all extubations resulting in terminal weans. Guiding patients and families through these goals of care discussions has a significant impact on residents' emotional and psychological well-being. To date, there is scant research on improving resident well being that is also compatible with the complexities of the current resident schedule. METHOD(S): We developed a monthly recurring faculty-free, time protected group session during work hours for residents to confidentially discuss events, situations, or feelings related to their time in the ICU without judgment or repercussion. A facilitator from Ascension Ministry Formation was present to aid in facilitating conversation. The first ICU resident support group session was held in late February 2022 by having residents use pictures (e.g. hurricanes, busy highways, etc) as allegorical tools to connect to their experiences in the ICU. After each session we collect feedback anonymously from residents to continue to improve future sessions. RESULT(S): In answering the question, "What are some reasons that you chose to share your experiences today", 70% of participants wished to hear other participants' perspectives. 40% wanted help in processing a difficult experience. After the discussion, 70% of residents noted that they felt more connected to their fellow residents/interns. 50% of residents felt that they were able to provide better patient care. 100% of participants responded that they would recommend other residents to participate in this discussion. CONCLUSION(S): Physician residents are tasked with a tough role as frontline care providers, especially within the scope of the pandemic. Providing a space with a facilitated discussion format using narrative processing has the potential to improve resident well being and ultimately reduce resident burnout and improve patient care. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Multiple studies have documented up to a 50% prevalence rate of resident burnout. Residencies nationally have created wellness programs to address sleep, fitness, and mindfulness; however, these programs typically take place outside of work hours which cuts into residents' already limited time away from the hospital. To date, there are very few studies in the literature on the effectiveness of these programs or how to specifically prevent emotional burnout. We believe that residency sponsored wellness programs that target emotional well being are critical to help create resilient and empathetic resident physicians.

T1  - Clinician-led mental health conversations significantly associated with outcomes for scoliosis patients
A1  - Zeck E.J.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The psychological impact of idiopathic scoliosis has been well established in the literature. While the diagnosis of scoliosis is concerning, bracing often compounds patients' stress, and patients have expressed wanting to discuss their feelings with their healthcare providers. Counseling can be an effective coping strategy for adolescents facing chronic illness, but it has not been studied in individuals diagnosed with scoliosis. AIM: To assess the frequency and effect of counseling and clinician-led mental health discussions on individuals diagnosed with scoliosis in childhood and adolescence. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Community-based research, online. POPULATION: Individuals diagnosed with scoliosis in childhood and adolescence. METHOD(S): The online survey included the SRS-22r, the BSSQ-Brace, questions about demographics, mental health, the Scolios-us Mentor Program, and general scoliosis experience. The survey was distributed to Scolios-us Mentor Program participants and to scoliosis clinicians to provide to their patients. Responses about mental health, experiences with healthcare providers, and counseling were analyzed for group differences and associations. RESULT(S): Fifty-five subjects participated in the study, with a median age of 13 (IQR: 3). Our results indicate that mental health is not being discussed as much as it is desired. A desire to discuss mental health was associated with lower function (P=0.005), mental health (P<0.001), SRS-22r total scores (P=0.002), and BSSQ-Brace scores (P=0.015). Subjects who engaged in a mental health discussion with one or more scoliosis healthcare providers exhibited higher management scores (P=0.002). Only 18.2% of subjects sought counseling, and two-thirds of these subjects found counseling to be very or extremely helpful. CONCLUSION(S): Mental health is not discussed by scoliosis providers as often as patients desire it, and a desire to have these conversations is negatively associated with several clinical outcomes. Although clinicians are not regularly talking about mental health, the positive associations of mental health discussions with clinical outcomes are encouraging. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: The ability to acknowledge the desire to discuss mental health, begin these discussions, and refer patients to a mental health professional may improve patient outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic placed immense stress on healthcare professionals worldwide. This strain often resulted in imbalances in their physical and mental well-being, necessitating effective coping mechanisms. In light of this context, this study investigates the correlations between the fear of COVID-19, self-coping strategies, and positive emotions, with particular reference to the Iranian health care industry. METHOD(S): Data were collected from 1050 healthcare professionals in Iran and the data were analysed sing structural equation modelling. RESULT(S): The study revealed that pandemic fear negatively impacts self-coping strategies and positive emotions during crisis scenarios. Conversely, self-coping strategies have a positive correlation with positive emotions. The research also underscored the role of resilience in reinforcing the favorable link between self-coping strategies and positive emotions. CONCLUSION(S): This study is one of the first to explore the significance of resilience and self-coping strategies among Iranian healthcare professionals during the pandemic. Its findings offer valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, paving the way for further contributions in this field. Future research endeavors may consider investigating the effects of various psychological interventions, including breathing techniques, self-talk, physical exercises, yoga, optimizing sleep, and dietary measures on the resilience and self-coping practices of healthcare professionals.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Psychological distress is a multi-factorial unpleasant experience of a psychological, social, spiritual, and/or physical nature that may interfere with one's ability to cope effectively with cancer, physical symptoms and treatment. Psychological distress is common and affects the prognosis of cancer patients. Lung cancer accounted for 11.4% of all new cancer cases and 18% of all cancer mortality for 36 cancers in 185 countries. The prevalence of distress among Chinese lung cancer patients ranged from 10.1% to 61.29%. However, the existing intervention studies on the psychological distress in lung cancer patients are limited and intervention results may be different. OBJECTIVE(S): To explore the psychological outcomes of a nurse-led systematic intervention program based on the stress-induced situation, affective, bodily, and cognitive reactions framework for patients with lung cancer undergoing operation at anxiety and depression. DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Thoracic surgery ward in a tertiary hospital in China. PARTICIPANTS: Lung cancer patients undergoing surgery. METHOD(S): This is a 12-month longitudinal randomized controlled study in a tertiary hospital in China. A total of 240 lung cancer patients were randomly divided into either the control group or the intervention group. The nurse-led systematic intervention contents include psychological education, intervention measures based on the stress-induced situation, affective, bodily, and cognitive reactions framework, issuance of daily lifestyle cards, and regular follow-ups. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale, and Satisfaction with Life Scale were used for the baseline assessment within 48h upon admission. The same assessment was performed respectively at 1, 3, 6 and 12months after the intervention started. The effects of the systematic interventions on depression, anxiety, fatigue, and life satisfaction were tested by a linear mixed effects model. RESULT(S): Overall time-by-group interaction effects were significantly different with regard to anxiety, depression, and fatigue after controlling for the covariates, while a significant time-by-group interaction effect was not found for life satisfaction. Changes for anxiety and depression scores at 6 and 12months after initiation of the intervention were significantly greater in the intervention group compared with those in the control group (t=3.046, p=0.002, t=3.190, p=0.001; t=3.735, p=0.000, t=2.979, p=0.002), whereas scores for fatigue were significantly higher in the intervention group at 6 and 12months (t=-3.096, p=0.002, t=-2.784, p=0.005). CONCLUSION(S): The systematic intervention program based on the stress-induced situation, affective, bodily, and cognitive reactions framework may effectively relieve anxiety, depression, and fatigue in lung cancer patients undergoing surgery.

N2  - Objectives: Emergency medicine (EM) clinicians are at exceptionally high risk for depression, anxiety, and PTSD due to repeated exposure to high-intensity patient care and chaotic work environments. These strains to one's emotional well-being often co-occur with burnout in health care and have been named "occupational hazards" associated with lower quality of care, high cost, and worse outcomes. EM physicians often fail to identify early signs of burnout and mental health strain such as poor sleep or reduced physical activity and are reluctant to seek treatment in part due to long-standing stigma and privacy concerns. Digital data such as ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and wearable devices offer a novel way to assess individual's real-time needs and provide personalized assessments of their mental health. This project aimed to develop a process of wearable device and EMA delivery and linkage to care using an iterative pilot of 20 EM providers and assess for feasibility and exploratory effects. Method(s): We conducted a 3-month pilot trial of 20 EM providers (10 residents and 10 nurses). Providers were given a wearable device to collect biometric data as well as a subscription to an app-based platform that provides individualized data insights and actionable daily practices and coaching to help manage stress, energy, and recovery. Participants completed a pre-survey and 6-weeks of a guided experience in the app followed by 6-weeks of self-exploration of the platform. Participants then completed a final survey to measure feasibility, acceptability, and exploratory effects. Result(s): In total, 20 EM providers enrolled in the study. Fifteen completed the pre-survey in the first app, and 10 successfully completed set-up to begin biometric data collection. Participants expressed a desire to be more self-aware to help them manage work-related stress. Among those who completed band setup, participants used the band for an average of 72.6 days (range 8 - 147). Participants found the interaction with data moderately useful (mean rating of 6) but found the platform somewhat difficult to use (mean rating of 4). Participants shared that they wished the device had a watch and noted that they struggled with the mechanics of the particular device. Analysis of exploratory effects is ongoing but preliminary data showed the highest user experienced moderate decreases in heart rate variability and strain scores over time. Conclusion(s): EM providers were interested in increased awareness of their body's physiologic response to work-related stress and found interaction with digital data useful. Challenges with completing set-up of the wearable device deterred participants from completing study instructions and signals a need for a streamlined data collection process. These results can inform future interventions using wearable devices and EMAs and highlight the importance of sustained participant engagement for the success of such interventions.

N2  - PURPOSE: Patients with chronic painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) may experience a negative impact of CIPN on daily life. They can use various coping (i.e., dealing with symptoms and resulting impairments in general) and self-management (i.e., practical actions to reduce symptoms) strategies to live with their limitations. This paper aimed to examine experienced helpful coping and self-management strategies of patients with chronic painful CIPN. METHOD(S): Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve patients with chronic painful CIPN. We applied a hybrid deductive-inductive coding approach. ATLAS.ti was used for coding. RESULT(S): Generated from the data were two themes and nine codes for coping and four themes and 31 codes for self-management strategies. Coping of patients often included active strategies like planning, seeking social support, and acceptance. Additionally, patients often used passive strategies such as focusing on and venting emotions and suppressing competing activities. The most common self-management strategies were mostly passive (i.e., medication, deliberate choice of shoes, resting, sitting, and consulting healthcare professionals) but also active (i.e., exercising) strategies. CONCLUSION(S): Patients exhibit a great variety of coping and self-management strategies that they perceive as helpful to deal with chronic painful CIPN. However, research has shown that certain strategies are not that helpful or even come with aversive effects. More research into the effectiveness and implementation of psychosocial interventions is needed since it may help patients adopting helping strategies. In addition, healthcare professionals need to refer patients with CIPN in a timely manner to physical therapists, occupational therapists, or rehabilitation teams to reduce or prevent (further) impairments. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Patients can consult one of their healthcare providers in case of problems in dealing with their symptoms, to get proper guidance and possible referral.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Moral injury can significantly negatively impact mental health, but currently no validated treatment for moral injury-related mental health difficulties exists in a UK context. This study aimed to examine whether the Restore and Rebuild (R&R) treatment was feasible to deliver, acceptable and well tolerated by UK military veterans with moral injury related mental health difficulties. METHOD(S): The R&R treatment was delivered to 20 patients who reported distress related to exposure to a morally injurious event(s) during military service. R&R is a 20-session psychotherapy with key themes of processing the event, self compassion, connecting with others and core values. Treatment was delivered online, weekly, one-to-one by a single therapist. Qualitative interviews with patients and the therapist who delivered R&R were conducted to explore acceptability and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULT(S): Following treatment, patients experienced a significant reduction in symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, alcohol misuse and moral injury related distress. R&R was found to be well tolerated by patients and improved their perceived wellbeing. CONCLUSION(S): These results provide preliminary evidence that veterans struggling with moral injury related mental ill health can benefit from R&R treatment.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on fractures in health care systems worldwide and continues to have a significant impact, particularly in relation to the health care workforce. Frontline staff have been exposed to unprecedented strain, and delivering care during the pandemic has affected their safety, mental health, and well-being. Objective(s): This study aimed to explore the experiences of health care workers (HCWs) delivering care in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic to understand their well-being needs, experiences, and strategies used to maintain well-being (at individual and organizational levels). Method(s): We analyzed 94 telephone interviews with HCWs and 2000 tweets about HCWs' mental health during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Result(s): The results were grouped under 6 themes: redeployment, clinical work, and sense of duty; well-being support and HCW's coping strategies; negative mental health effects; organizational support; social network and support; and public and government support. Conclusion(s): These findings demonstrate the need for open conversations, where staff's well-being needs and the strategies they adopted can be shared and encouraged, rather than implementing top-down psychological interventions alone. At the macro level, the findings also highlighted the impact on HCW's well-being of public and government support as well as the need to ensure protection through personal protective equipment, testing, and vaccines for frontline workers.Copyright © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

N2  - The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed the prenatal care experience, specifically regarding medical appointments and social opportunities. It is critical to capture this change through the narratives of pregnant people, particularly those of marginalized populations, whose voices may often be underrepresented in the literature. This mixed-methods paper summarizes the experiences of 40 pregnant Black/African American (AA) women during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, online survey was administered between 2020 and 2021 to assess prenatal health and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients' pregnancy experience. Coping behaviors during the pandemic were self-reported using the COPE-IS. Univariate analyses were conducted. An additional analysis of participants (n = 4) was explored through a week-long qualitative exercise using a photo documentation procedure. Photo-Elicitation Interviews (PEI) were conducted to capture and center their pandemic pregnancy experiences. Sources of stress during the pandemic varied, with the most common being financial concerns (n = 19, 47.5%). Over half of the sample (n = 18, 54.5%) self-reported increases in their positive coping behaviors during the pandemic, such as communicating with friends and family, talking to healthcare providers, listening to music, and engaging in spiritual practices-such as prayer. The four PEI study participants reflected on the impacts of social distancing on their prenatal experience and mentioned hospital and provider-related weariness due to their race. The findings of this study suggest that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Black/AA pregnant women in Charlotte, NC used social support, mindfulness practices, self-advocacy, and health literacy to navigate challenges present during their prenatal health experience. This paper highlights the personal, social, and structural experiences of pregnant women during a public health crisis so that responsive and effective programs or policies can be planned in the future.Copyright © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The critical care nursing workforce is in crisis, with one-third of critical care nurses worldwide intending to leave their roles. This paper aimed to examine the problem from a wellbeing perspective, offering implications for research, and potential solutions for organisations. DESIGN: Discursive/Position paper. METHOD(S): The discussion is based on the nursing and wellbeing literature. It is guided by the authors' collaborative expertise as both clinicians and researchers. Data were drawn from nursing and wellbeing peer-reviewed literature, such as reviews and empirical studies, national surveys and government and thinktank publications/reports. RESULT(S): Critical care nurses have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with studies consistently showing critical care nurses to have the worst psychological outcomes on wellbeing measures, including depression, burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These findings are not only concerning for the mental wellbeing of critical care nurses, they also raise significant issues for healthcare systems/organisations: poor wellbeing, increased burnout and PTSD are directly linked with critical care nurses intending to leave the profession. Thus, the wellbeing of critical care nurses must urgently be supported. Resilience has been identified as a protective mechanism against the development of PTSD and burnout, thus offering evidence-based interventions that address resilience and turnover have much to offer in tackling the workforce crisis. However, turnover data must be collected by studies evaluating resilience interventions, to further support their evidence base. Organisations cannot solely rely on the efficacy of these interventions to address their workforce crisis but must concomitantly engage in organisational change. CONCLUSION(S): We conclude that critical care nurses are in urgent need of preventative, evidence-based wellbeing interventions, and make suggestions for research and practice.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) was developed by Shapiro (1989). EMDR is an integrative evidence-based therapy, that for over twenty years, has been used to treat disorders relating to traumatic stress and distressing life experiences (Shapiro, 1995, 2001). EMDR relies on an AIP model that proposes that present problems are based on earlier experiences that have been dysfunctionally registered in the brain and need to be reprocessed (Shapiro, 2012). The primary usage of EMDR therapy was within the military personnel diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. The EMDR therapy contains eight phases: History, Preparation, Assessment, Desensitization, Installation, Body Scan, Closure and Re-evaluation (Shapiro, 1995 and second edition 2001). Individuals who suffered traumatization can develop a series of problems like intrusive memories, nightmares, irritability, flashbacks, new fears, and avoidance strategies. When the individual is traumatized they experience such strong emotions that is thought to overwhelm the brain. Consequently the brain is unable to cope with it, or to process the information. The information processing theory suppose that this blocked information processing is facilitated by alternating bilateral stimulation (ABLS) using left/right eye movements, tactile stimulations or sounds (J. M.-Smith, M. Silvestre, 2014). NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) guidelines recommend to "Using the EMDR therapy for children and adolescents (7-17 years old) with a diagnosis of PTSD or clinically important symptoms of PTSD who have presented more than 3 months after a traumatic event only if they do not respond to or engage with trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy" (NICE, 2018). Also AACAP recommends EMDR therapy for adults and children with PTSD, and explaining that it's effective for adults but the most randomized controlled trials for child EMDR have had serious methodologic shortcomings (Journal of The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry Volume 49, number 4, April 2010).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Today, the addition of psychosocial skills training programs to schizophrenia treatment becomes increasingly important. Psychosocial Skills Training (PST) is a program that facilitates patients to cope with the disorder, prevents exacerbations and recurrences, improves social functioning, disease-related insight, compliance with drug treatment and quality of life. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of PST application on clinical features such as symptom pattern, depression level, insight, treatment compliance and functionality in a group of patients with schizophrenia followed in Community Mental Health Center (CMHC). METHOD(S): The study sample consisted of 30 schizophrenic outpatients diagnosed according to DSM-V diagnostic criteria. The patients were divided into three groups, each group consisted of 10 people. The training was given by the same researchers for 18 weeks in two sessions, each of which lasted forty-five minutes. The test battery was applied at the beginning and at the end of the training. Sociodemographic Data Form, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Calgary Schizophrenia Depression Scale (CSDS), Schedule for Assessing the Three Components of Insight (SATCI), Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS), Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSPS) were applied as part of the test battery. RESULT(S): Of the 30 patients, twenty-two were able to complete the training. When mean scale scores of cases who completed the training were compared at the beginning and at the end of the study, no statistically significant difference was found in PANSS positive symptoms (baseline 20.00+/-8.39, post-PST 18.71+/-4.85; p=0.184) and negative symptoms (baseline 21.78+/-7.29; post-PST 17.79+/-6.50) subscale scores. However, mean scores of PANSS general psychopathology subscale (baseline 42.82+/-14.19; post-PST 25.43+/-8.76; p=0.011) and PANSS total (baseline 82.79+/-25.55; post-PST 59.07+/-14.66; p=0.043) decreased significantly. There was no significant difference in the mean score of CSDS (Baseline 13.29+/-9.36; post-PST 10.43 +/- 8.63; p = 0.207). The mean scores of SATCI (baseline 12.14+/-2.74, post-PST 16.29+/-2.49; p=0.002), MMAS (Baseline 4.25+/-1.32, post-PST 4.86+/-1.09; p=0.017) and PSPS (baseline 46.43+/-16.22, post-PST 66.86+/-11.55; p=0.002) improved significantly after the training. CONCLUSION(S): With this study, we emphasized the importance of creating therapy programs in CHMC. This study demonstrated that the PST program contributes considerable improvements to general psychopathology, treatment compliance, and functionality for schizophrenia patients. At the same time, significant improvement was obtained in terms of insight in the subjects who completed the program. Since the addition of this training program to the routine treatment of schizophrenia has contributed positively to the clinical pattern and functionalities of the patients, it is important to increase the awareness of mental health professionals in this area.

N2  - AIMS: The present study aimed to explore the effects of a guided self-help mindfulness intervention on psychological resilience and job burnout among psychiatric nurses. BACKGROUND: Psychiatric nurses work in challenging and potentially high stress settings. Mindfulness interventions can improve psychological resilience and reduce job burnout of nurses. However, face-to-face delivery of mindfulness interventions may be inconvenient for individuals. Guided self-help interventions may be more accessible. METHOD(S): This randomized controlled trial was conducted from January to August 2022. One hundred and eighteen psychiatric nurses were randomized into the intervention and control groups. The individuals in the intervention group received an 8-week guided self-help mindfulness intervention, while the individuals in the control group received a psycho-educational brochure. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey were used to evaluate the levels of mindfulness, psychological resilience and job burnout, respectively. RESULT(S): After an 8-week intervention, compared with the control group, the levels of mindfulness and psychological resilience were higher, while the level of job burnout was lower in the intervention group. CONCLUSION(S): The guided self-help mindfulness intervention can improve psychological resilience and reduce job burnout among psychiatric nurses.Copyright © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals, especially professional nurses, experience various types of moral suffering due to inevitable ethical conflicts. Moral resilience is recently proposed as a resource to address moral suffering. However, there is no tool to measure moral resilience in Chinese professional nurses. AIM: This study aimed to translate the Rushton Moral Resilience Scale (RMRS) into Chinese and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of RMRS (Chi-RMRS). RESEARCH DESIGN: A methodological and descriptive research design. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: A convenience sample of 411 Chinese professional nurses was recruited through an online survey platform between February and March 2023. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University and hospitals involved. RESULT(S): The RMRS was translated and culturally adapted into a Chinese version. Neither floor nor ceiling effects were observed. The scale-level content validity index (CVI) was 0.922 with the item-level CVIs ranging from 0.833 to 1.000. The explanatory factor analysis (EFA) generated a three-factor structure for the Chi-RMRS, and the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) demonstrated the three-factor structure with factor loadings for each item ranging from 0.42 to 0.80. The scale-level Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.811 with each dimension ranging from 0.717 to 0.821, and composite reliability (CR) coefficient for the overall scale was 0.920, with each dimension varying from 0.739 to 0.824. The standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest detectable change (SDC) were 3.522 and 9.763, respectively. DISCUSSION: The Chi-RMRS is able to measure moral resilience of Chinese professional nurses, and has good validity and reliability. It can be used in research and practice to determine the level of moral resilience, thus helping nursing managers to monitor the status of Chinese professional nurses, then develop interventions to maintain the well-being of professional nurses and to ensure quality of care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is adversely impacting the mental health and well-being of frontline nurses worldwide. It is therefore important to understand how such impact can be mitigated, including by studying psychological capacities that could help the nurses regulate and minimize the impact. AIM: To examine the role of psychological flexibility in mitigating the adverse impacts of burnout and low job satisfaction on mental health problems (i.e., anxiety, depression, and stress) and well-being among the frontline nurses in Hong Kong and Switzerland during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, two-region survey study. METHOD(S): Four hundred fifty-two nurses from Hong Kong (n = 158) and Switzerland (n = 294) completed an online survey. An adjusted structured equation model was used to examine the interrelationship of the constructs. RESULT(S): Psychological flexibility was found to partially mediate the effects of job satisfaction on mental well-being (beta = 0.32, 95% CI [0.19, 0.57], p = 0.001) and mental health problems (beta = -0.79, 95% CI [-1.57, -0.44], p = 0.001), respectively. Similarly, this partial mediation was found in the effects of burnout on mental well-being (beta = -0.35, 95% CI [-0.89, -0.15], p = 0.002) and mental health problems (beta = 0.89, 95% CI [0.48, 3.65], p = 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Psychological flexibility could be a crucial psychological resilience factor against the adverse impact of nurses' burnout on their mental health problems and well-being during COVID-19. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Organizational measures should focus on fostering psychological flexibility in nurses through highly accessible, brief psychotherapeutic interventions, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, to reduce the impact on mental health.Copyright © 2023 Sigma Theta Tau International.

N2  - Objectives To explore how primary care health professionals perceive their own mental health in a conflict-affected setting during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore their perspectives on mental health services. Methods The Gaza Strip faces a chronic humanitarian crisis and is suffering from the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic; United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) health centres were used to recruit participants for this study. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 29 health professionals in UNRWA health centres who were sampled using maximum variation sampling. Transcripts were translated, double checked and analysed via thematic analysis. Results From the analysis, a thematic map was developed showing how health professionals perceive their mental health impacts. This included difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the socioeconomic processes stemming from the on-going conflict. Another thematic map was developed showing the perceived strengths and challenges of the health services. The strengths included positive impact of the services to the service users and health professionals. In terms of challenges, health professionals identified socioeconomic processes and aspects of remote service provision during COVID-19. Conclusions Based on the findings, we suggest that an improved signposting mechanism should be developed to address many of the challenges that emergencies bring about; in particular, this could support the health professionals' mental health, as well as improve the response to patients' socioeconomic challenges. We further suggest recommendations for improving mental health services when delivered remotely to increase their resiliency during various emergencies.Copyright © 2023 BMJ Case Reports.

N2  - Background: Currently, conflict become common phenomenon in the world affecting the lives of millions of children. Due the continued conflict in Ethiopia millions of children are suffering from extreme levels of violence, lack of basic humanitarian needs, and lack of health services. Objective(s): This study was designed to assess the effect of conflict on child and adolescent health in Amhara region, September 2022. Method(s): A community-based cross-sectional study was employed among children agedd < 18 years in conflict affected areas of Amhara region. The sample size was determined using a single population proportion formula. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews of children or child legal guardians. Data was cleaned, verified, and entered into EpiData version 3.1 and analysis was done using SPSS version 24 statistical software. Result(s): Seven hundred and ninety-eight children agedd less than 18 years were involved with a response rate of 94.33 percent. More than one thirds (276, 34.59%) of children were displaced due to the conflict. Three hundred and thirty one (41.48%) children get diseased with the majority didn't receive treatment. More than two thirds (557, 69.80%) of children had experienced violence of different types. One hundred and thirty four (41.23%) children had acute malnutrition with two third (66.42%) of them had severe acute malnutrition. Conclusion(s): Conflict had deadly impacts on the lives of children and adolescents. It causes massive displacement, lack of basic humanitarian needs, extreme level of violence, hunger and malnutrition, and lack of health services. The government and other national and international humanitarian aids should give special attention to children living in war zone of Amhara region. In addition, rehabilitation services and resilience training should be designed and provided to children affected by the conflict.Copyright © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Signposting to web-based interventions is becoming increasingly popular in primary care. Most resources are focused on individuals with clinical problems, but less is known about the uptake of general practice (GP) signposted web-based interventions. GPs in Denmark are responsible for scheduled preventive care during pregnancy and the child's first five years. In the "Family Well-being in General Practice" trial the web-based intervention "Resilientchild.dk" is introduced at these consultations. Resilientchild.dk is designed to improve the capacity of parents to understand the mental state of themselves, their partners, and their children. In this study we assess the uptake and use of this web-based intervention. OBJECTIVE(S): To describe participant and practice characteristics associated with the use of a web-based psychoeducational intervention. Eligible participants were pregnant women presenting at their first antenatal assessment, usually around 6-10 gestational weeks. METHOD(S): The study was nested in a cluster randomised trial of resilientchild.dk. We conducted a relative importance analysis, which allows for determination of the variables most strongly associated with website use. To assess the direction and magnitude of the influences of the identified variables, we applied multinomial generalized linear mixed modelling. A practice random effect allows us to account for clustering of women within practices. RESULT(S): Parity and the absence of a nurse or midwife in the practice were important factors driving a decrease in the likelihood of using resilientchild.dk. Being a student or living outside the capital city were important factors driving an increase in the likelihood of using resilientchild.dk. CONCLUSION(S): The data offer unique opportunities to assess the utilisation of a web-based mental health-promotion intervention following advice from a clinician. This study draws conclusions about which patients are likely to access similar resources and which practice characteristics encourage their use.

T1  - Relationship Between Resilience, Emotional Intelligence, and Age
A1  - McGuire C. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - PURPOSE: To explore the relationship between resilience, emotional intelligence (EI), and age in students enrolled in health care professional programs. METHOD(S): Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants by posting a survey link in health care courses at a midsized southeastern public university in the United States. The survey included 5 demographic questions, the Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test, and the Brief Resilience Scale. A multiple linear regression model was conducted to examine the relationship between age, EI, and resilience. RESULT(S): A total of 199 students participated in the study, consisting of 178 females (89.4%) and 21 males (10.6%). The collective study findings indicated a significant predictive relationship among EI, age, and resilience. The multiple linear regression findings were significant (F2,194 = 58.48, P < .001, and R2 = 0.376), suggesting a predictive relationship among EI, age, and resilience. The coefficient of determination, R2, indicated that approximately 37.6% of the variance in resilience was explained by EI and age. DISCUSSION: The shortage in the health care workforce combined with increasing reports of burnout and attrition among workers emphasizes the critical role of education programs in preparing future health care professionals. Understanding the effect of EI and age on levels of resilience might help educators develop collaborative interventions. Educators should consider incorporating EI skills development in the curriculum to influence positive retention and clinical experiences for health care students that translate to their careers in the health care profession. CONCLUSION(S): The significant predictive relationship of EI and age with resilience offers insight into the possible solution of increasing resilience skills by integrating EI in the curriculum.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Radiologic Technologists.

N2  - Background: Despite improvements in antirheumatic pharmacological treatment, people with inflammatory arthritis still report substantial disease impact. Based on the framework for complex interventions, we developed a self-management intervention (INSELMA). After initial assessment and goal setting, a rheumatology nurse coordinated interdisciplinary support and available offers in primary care to help patients achieve their individual goals. 17 participants with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or axial spondylarthritis completed the six-month intervention. The aim of this study was to explore the participants' experience of feasibility and potential benefit from the intervention. Method(s): Individual semi-structured interviews were planned with the participants two weeks after completing the intervention. Thematic analysis was applied. Result(s): Fifteen participants participated in an interview (9 women, 6 men, age 44-75 years). The analysis derived four themes. 1. A new opportunity. Participation in INSELMA was experienced as an opportunity to improve, reduce challenges, or change issues they had fought alone. 2. The importance of person-centered goals. The individual goals encompassed physical, social, and emotional areas. When expectations and goals were aligned, it facilitated a positive outcome. Access to a physiotherapist and occupational therapist with rheumatology experience as well as time between consultations to work with their goals was important. 3. A little nudging means everything. The empathic support and coaching from the nurses and the interdisciplinary team, who understood their problems were considered especially valuable. Some would like continued follow-up with the nurse after the end of the study to stay committed. 4. I got more than I wished for. Most participants experienced decreased symptoms, improvement in physical strength, mobility, and sleep as well as increased physical activity, energy, and coping. The intervention contributed to refreshed knowledge and increased motivation to change habits. Participants expressed hope for the future having new tools to prevent future problems and manage the symptoms. Conclusion(s): The participants found INSELMA feasible as an opportunity to address personal challenges and improve physical, social, and emotional self-management skills. They experienced decreased disease impact and increased activity level, facilitated by self-management support from the health professionals.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Military personnel experience training and operational demands that are different from civilian populations, including frequent deployment, exposure to austere environments, and dislocation from family. These unique occupational demands may result in negative impacts on health, performance, and career success. As such, resilience, defined as a system's capacity to resist, recover, recover better, or adapt, to perturbation from a challenge or stressor, is a critical factor in assuring the health and safety of military personnel. In recent years, the Department of Defense (DoD) has funded research programs assessing the physiological basis of resilience. This review will overview research programs, review salient findings from recent studies, and highlight potential future areas of research. Physiological factors influencing or predicting resilience in US military populations, including physical performance, anthropometrics and body composition, nutrition and dietary supplements, and other biomarkers will be highlighted. Finally, this manuscript will detail potential future studies, including interventions, aimed at optimising physiological resilience in military personnel.Copyright Published 2023.

N2  - Introduction: This study aimed to understand the impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has on the mental health and well-being of pregnant and parenting adolescents and young adults (AYA) to identify unique challenges they faced. Method(s): Pregnant and parenting AYA from a teen and tot program at a safety-net hospital in the northeast participated in semistructured qualitative interviews. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded. Analysis was conducted using modified grounded theory and content analysis. Result(s): Fifteen pregnant and parenting AYA participated in interviews. Participants were aged 19-28 years (mean age, 22.6). Participants reported adverse mental health experiences, namely increased loneliness, depression, and anxiety, engagement in preventive measures to protect their children's health, positive attitudes toward telemedicine because of efficiency and safety, delayed attainment of personal and professional goals, and increased attitudes of resilience. Discussion(s): Health care professionals should offer expanded screening and support resources to pregnant and parenting AYA during this time.Copyright © 2023 National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners

N2  - Background Burnout negatively affects nurses and increases nursing turnover. Many student nurses experience burnout throughout their academic program, negatively affecting student success and patient care. Objectives To explore effects of mindfulness education / self-care skills training in undergraduate nursing students on stress and self-care. Design A four-week pilot with four-week follow-up. Setting In-person mindfulness sessions were offered to first-year nursing students. Participants 67 students enrolled in a nursing skills course. Methods Four in-person mindfulness educational sessions were provided with a 4-week follow-up. Outcomes were stress and self-care, measured by the Perceived Stress Scale and Mindful Self-Care Scale at pre-, post-, and follow-up. Results 58 (86.6%) completed pilot; mean age=22.8 (5.75), majority females (84%) and Caucasian (79%). Students practicing one or more mindfulness techniques at least 8 times outside class increased self-care 9.5% pre- to post-intervention (p=.01), although not sustained at follow-up. Stress did not change significantly in either direction (p=.94), potentially mediating the stress of starting clinical immediately following the intervention. Conclusions Mindfulness education increased self-care in first-year nursing students who practiced mindfulness outside class. Recommendations include further research and integration of mindfulness into courses to assess benefits and coping skills for future nurses.

N2  - Background Severe mental illness is characterized by severe changes in functionality interfering with daily life activities. The home-dwelling person with severe mental illness often needs support from family members who assume the role of caregivers. The performance of the role of family caregiver often leads to a burden, with an impact on physical and mental health. As so, the caregiver develops coping strategies to deal with stressful situations. Among these, spiritual coping strategies are often used, which involve the relationship with oneself, others, and/or the transcendent/God or nature and may include religious or spiritual practices. These strategies are related to improvement in physical and mental well-being. The specialist nurse in mental and psychiatric health has competencies, such as the systemic assessment and intervention based on the biological, psychological, social, cultural, and spiritual dimensions aiming at the promotion of well-being and mental health. The main goal of this study was to develop and test the intervention "promoting spiritual coping" in the family caregivers of home-dwelling people with mental illness. Materials and methods A mixed-method study with a sequential exploratory design was conducted, using the development and feasibility/pilot phases of the Medical Research Council's framework. The development stage included a systematic literature review according to Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines; two focus groups with caregivers and experts; and an online modified e-Delphi. The test phase consisted of a pilot test with ten family caregivers of home-dwelling people with a mental illness accompanied by the community mental health structures of health units in the Lisbon region. The outcomes included spiritual coping, quality of life, and the burden of the family caregiver. Results A protocol for the intervention was developed and tested with a group of ten family caregivers. A three-session intervention was implemented. The outcomes were assessed pre and post-intervention. Significant changes were observed in the outcomes and the family caregivers mentioned that it was helpful to discuss issues regarding spirituality and religiosity. Conclusion The intervention "promoting spiritual coping" was developed and tested, considered appropriate for family caregivers of people with mental illness, to be applied in psychotherapeutic context by mental health nurses.

N2  - Background and aims: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was associated with marked decreases in access to lab based blood borne pathogen testing, including HCV molecular diagnostics. While new diagnoses may have decreased, it was unclear if all other parts of the HCV care cascade engagement would also decrease during each year of the pandemic. Our goal was to describe engagement in care across the care cascade before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a statewide coordinated virtual HCV care program. Method(s): Nova Scotia is a Canadian province with approximately 1,000,000 population. From 2017 to 2022, the majority of HCV care was initiated through in a province wide programwhich converted to a fully virtual, nurse delegated program in July 2020 with the advent of the pandemic. We measured the number of referrals, care engagements, treatment starts, documented SVRs (sustained virologic responses), and treatment failures annually from 2019 (considered pre-pandemic) until December 2022. Result(s): HCV program referrals decreased approximately 30% in 2020/21 (187,183) compared to 2019 (264) and 2022 (220). However, initial virtual visits to establish care were stable across 2019 (69), 2020 (85), and 2021 (67), and increase to 114 in 2022. 158 people initiated treatment in 2019, compared with 135 in 2020, 115 in 2021 and 93 in 2022. SVR was status was known in 111 people in 2019, compared to 104 people in 2020, 75 in 2021, and 21 in 2022. Treatment failure or reinfection was stable over all years. Conclusion(s): New HCV infection estimation was limited during the pandemic, given the lack of point of care and lab-based HCV testing in the province. However, conversion to a virtual platform, centralized referral and treatment, as well as expert delegated nurse role was associated with equivalent engagement in care but slightly decreased treatment initiation. Building HCV care resilience through virtual and delegated collaborative prescriber programs should be considered in future pandemic preparedness planning and blood borne pathogen management.Copyright © 2023 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

N2  - AIM: To explore the job demands of healthcare workers (HCWs) working in mobile cabin hospitals in Shanghai and identify the influencing factors. DESIGN: The study had a cross-sectional design. METHOD(S): Using the convenience sampling method, we selected 1223 HCWs (medical team members) working in these mobile cabin hospitals during April-May 2022. The findings of the general information questionnaire and the hierarchy scale of job demands of HCWs working in mobile cabin hospitals were used for the investigation. RESULT(S): The total score of job demands of the included HCWs was 132.26+/-9.53; the average score of the items was 4.73+/-0.34. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that the following HCWs had significantly higher job demands: female HCWs and HCWs who received psychological training or intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic, were satisfied with the doctor/nurse-patient relationship, received support from family members/friends/colleagues, believed that the risk of working in mobile cabin hospitals was high, had adapted to the working environment of mobile cabin hospitals and had college/undergraduate level of education. They would benefit from increased social support and better training in terms of psychological coping mechanisms(both theoretical knowledge and applicable skills) and COVID-19 prevention,control and treatment abilities.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Introduction: More than 20% of patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer report anxiety specifically related to the immobilisation mask, a tight-fighting mask patients are required to wear for the duration of each treatment session. However, limited research has investigated this from the patient perspective. The aim of this study was to better understand patient experiences of mask anxiety during head and neck cancer radiation therapy and to explore patient attitudes toward potential strategies that may reduce mask anxiety during this treatment. Method(s): Five patients with head and neck cancer, who had self-reported mask anxiety during radiation therapy, participated in semi-structured, qualitative interviews exploring their experiences of anxiety and suggestions for reducing anxiety. A codebook thematic analysis was conducted. Result(s): Six main themes were identified: (1) triggers of anxiety; (2) adjusting to radiation therapy; (3) education about the mask; (4) coping; (5) motivation and (6) improving the patient experience. Conclusion(s): Findings from these interviews provide valuable insight into how and when healthcare providers may be able to assist patients to manage mask anxiety. Recommendations include increased communication from health care providers; delivery of visual information to improve patient preparedness; exposure/opportunities to interact with the masks prior to treatment commencing and increased control of music/soundtrack selection. However, a limitation of this study is the small sample size and further research is warranted.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - AIM: To understand the current application and benefits of coaching practice in nursing and identify potential areas for future research. DESIGN: An integrative literature review was conducted using Whittemore and Knalf integrative review methods. DATA SOURCES: A search of the literature from Medline (PubMed) and CINHAL platform for abstracts and/or full-text articles from 2012 to 2022. METHOD(S): A systematic approach was used to screen and analyse the literature. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, a quality appraisal of the literature was undertaken and summarised into themes. Eighteen articles were selected, two articles were different aspects of the same studies. Coaching was found to have benefits to the individual related to performance, role effectiveness, role transitions and confidence in performing in the role. The outcomes for individuals add to the overall organisational benefits with performance, support, teamwork, communication and culture. RESULT(S): This literature review sought to understand the current use of coaching in nursing and identify any gaps in the application of coaching within the discipline. Supporting, developing staff knowledge and skills and nurturing nursing staff into the profession has occurred in several ways and evolved to include coaching. Coaching provides capabilities to enhance nursing leadership, performance improvement and to provide support to staff. The findings from this literature review found a need to conceptually define coaching in nursing and the opportunity to explore the use of coaching to support both the clinical and managerial workforce (job satisfaction, intention to stay and building resilience). The benefits of coaching in nursing extend beyond the leadership level and there is opportunity to extend the operationalisation of coaching practice and coaching training within the discipline of nursing. This integrative review explains how coaching has been utilised in nursing to be a valuable tool in developing nurse leaders and clinical staff.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - The study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of workplace violence (WPV) against pediatric emergency healthcare workers and evaluate the relationship between WPV and psychological resilience. This study is cross-sectional and correlational. According to the results, the prevalence of WPV was 69.8%, and its distribution was as follows: verbal abuse (56.9%), bullying/mobbing (37.6%), physical abuse (12.8%), and sexual abuse (2.2%). Being single/separated/divorced/widowed (odds ratio [OR]: 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-3.30), being a physician (OR: 4.74, 95% CI: 1.73-12.96), being a staff member (OR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.10-5.99), routine direct physical contact with patients/clients (OR: 2.77, 95% CI: 1.40-5.48), and lack of encouragement to report WPV (OR: 3.76, 95% CI: 2.01-7.01) were independent predictors of WPV (P <.05), and WPV was found to be associated with low psychological resilience. Arrangements related to violence prevention, preparation, and intervention should be made and maintained in all pediatric emergency departments.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused wide-spread disruptions to the conduct of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), particularly those involving public health services. Using the Get Back to Healthy trial as an example, this study aimed to contextualise the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on implementation of RCTs involving public health services in Australia, summarise the effect of common and novel contingency strategies employed to mitigate these challenges, and describe key lessons learned. Method(s): The main challenges, the effect of contingency strategies employed, and key lessons learned were summarised descriptively. Result(s): The main COVID-19-related challenge has been slow recruitment due to the suspension of clinical services for the trial target population. This challenge has been addressed through carefully considered adjustments to trial design (i.e., expanding the trial eligibility criteria), which has markedly improved trial recruitment rates. Other challenges have included the rapid transition to remote consent and data collection methods, increased complexity of monitoring participant safety, and future statistical challenges with disentangling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic from treatment effects. The key lessons learned are: (i) adaptations to trial design may be necessary during a pandemic; (ii) offering remote methods may encourage trial participation from all age groups during a pandemic; (iii) enhanced monitoring of safety is critical during a pandemic; (iv) statistical challenges are likely to occur and should be considered when interpreting trial results. Conclusion(s): Key lessons learned may be useful for informing the conduct of resilient RCTs, particularly those involving public health services, in the present and future.Copyright © 2023 The Authors

N2  - Background and aim: Enhancing public health communication during a global crisis is crucial to promote resilience. This study examines the influence of health communication in ten countries, analysing its positive and negative impact on society's behavior regarding the origin, symptoms, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Method(s): A comprehensive narrative analysis of available data was conducted to evaluate societal and resilience responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study consulted academic and grey literature, from February 1, 2020, to March 1, 2022, focusing on ten countries that exhibited heterogenous responses to pandemic, including EU (Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, Romania, France, and Germany) and non-EU (United Kingdom and Israel) countries. Result(s): The stringency of policy responses varied between countries and over time, with some countries implementing strict lockdowns while others only issued recommendations. Vaccination campaign and the spread of less virulent variants of the virus has led most countries to lift most restrictions by April 2022. However, vaccine uptake and refusal remain complex issues influenced by social norms, cultural beliefs, access to information, and trust in government authorities. Social media played a significant role during the pandemic, but healthcare professionals' active participation in addressing misinformation was lacking. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of Public Health in developing proper strategies and utilizing digitals tools to counteract infodemic and spread relevant information. Healthcare workers should improve their communication skills to face future epidemics and be trusted by the population. Social media and digital platforms should be studied and used effectively in times of emergency. (www.actabiomedica.it).Copyright © Mattioli 1885.

N2  - Health professional competency building is one of nine national responsibilities (to achieve universal coverage and sustainability) described in the 2018 World Health Organization/UNICEF implementation guidance for the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI). Skilled breastfeeding support as a standard of newborn care is critical to the establishment of lactation and exclusive breastfeeding. This qualitative case study describes the Kyrgyz Republic's experience with health professional competency building related to breastfeeding counselling and support. We interviewed 38 key informants and reviewed national policies and international guidelines related to BFHI. The study found that although the country has a new policy reflecting BFHI global standards and guidance, the policy has not been disseminated nationally. Additionally, the policy lacks guidance on competency monitoring and verification and does not mention preservice training, even though preservice training on breastfeeding support exists. To achieve universal coverage for health professional competencies, the Kyrgyz Republic uses preservice, in-service and refresher training. However, the main limitations to aligning with the new guidance are a lack of preservice BFHI- and breastfeeding-specific curricula, experienced trainers and sufficient time and funding to dedicate to practical skill development. Conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study confirmed disruptions to BFHI training and service delivery but also documents the Kyrgyz Republic's resilient strides to mitigate impacts on breastfeeding support through facility-level individual champions and adjustments to training such as going online. Opportunities exist for strengthening the competencies of service providers through strengthened preservice training, comprehensive and consistent in-service training, solutions for overworked service providers and clear and sufficiently funded monitoring guidance.Copyright © 2023 John Snow Research & Training Institute.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the mental health burden on the general population, resulting in increased demands on mental healthcare professionals, including psychotherapists. This cross-sectional study assessed the challenges and resources encountered by 513 psychotherapists based on an online survey conducted between April and May 2022. Method(s): Qualitative methods content analysis of written reports was employed to investigate the emerging challenges and sources of support during the pandemic. A comparative analysis of burdens, resources, sociodemographic factors and daily physical activity was conducted to discern patterns of good and poor well-being. Result(s): The predominant burden identified was mental health-related issues, followed by global crises and government-imposed restrictions to mitigate virus transmission. Essential resources encompassed social connections, mindfulness, work satisfaction, and internal processes. Notably, psychotherapists demonstrating good well-being were older, more physically active, had a lower proportion of females, were employed in private practices rather than in institutionalized settings, had more years of professional experience and treated more patients weekly than their counterparts with poor well-being. Furthermore, they exhibited greater optimism, health focus, and satisfaction with their coping methods. Discussion(s): These findings can help develop support systems, policies, and educational programs to better support mental health professionals during global crises and offer strategies for individual practitioners to maintain their well-being.Copyright © 2023 Schaffler, Bauer, Schein, Jesser, Probst, Pieh and Humer.

N2  - Background: Since 8 January 2023 China has liberalized its control of COVID-19. In a short period of time, the infection rate of COVID-19 in China has risen rapidly, which has brought a heavy burden to medical staff. This study aimed to investigate the psychological status, stress, insomnia, effort-reward imbalance, resilience, and influencing factors of medical staff in China during the period of epidemic policy liberalization. Method(s): This survey was conducted from 6 February to 27 March 2023 with non-random sampling. An online questionnaire survey was conducted using HADS, PSS-14, ISI, ERI, and the resilience assessment scale for medical staff. The levels of psychological, stress, insomnia, effort-reward imbalance, and resilience of medical staff during the pandemic policy opening period were measured. Result(s): A total of 2,038 valid questionnaires were collected. 68.5% and 53.9% of medical staff had different degrees of anxiety and depression, respectively. Excessive stress, insomnia, and high effort and low reward were 40.2%, 43.2%, and 14.2%, respectively. Gender, Profession, education level, and age are important factors that lead to anxiety and depression. Women, nurses, higher education, longer working years and hours, high effort, and low reward are risk factors for the above conditions. There was a certain correlation among the five scales, among which anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, effort-reward imbalance, and other factors were positively correlated, while resilience was negatively correlated with these factors. Conclusion(s): This study found that anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, and other psychological problems of medical staff in China during the policy opening period of COVID-19 were more serious than before. At the individual and organizational levels, it is necessary to improve the well-being of medical staff, optimize the allocation of human resources, and promote the mental health of medical staff with a focus on prevention and mitigation, with the entry point of improving resilience and preventing the effort-reward imbalance.Copyright © 2023 Cheng, Tao, Liu, He, Chen, Sun and Chen.

N2  - Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has wide-reaching health and non-health consequences, especially on mental health and psychosocial well-being. Healthcare workers involved in COVID-19 patient care are particularly vulnerable to psychosocial distress due to increased pressure on healthcare systems. We explored the psychosocial experiences of front-line healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sierra Leone. Methods This qualitative study used purposive sampling to recruit 13 healthcare workers from different cadres across 5 designated COVID-19 treatment centres in Freetown, Sierra Leone. In-depth interviews were conducted remotely in July and August 2020, transcribed verbatim and analysed using the framework approach. Results This study identified three overarching themes: vulnerability, resilience and support structures. Participants expressed vulnerability relating to the challenging work environment and lack of medications as key stressors resulting in anxiety, stress, anger, isolation and stigmatisation. Signs of resilience with experiences drawn from the 2014 Ebola outbreak, teamwork and a sense of duty were also seen. Peer support was the main support structure with no professional psychosocial support services available to healthcare workers. Conclusions This is the first study to provide evidence of the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers in Sierra Leone. Despite signs of resilience and coping mechanisms displayed, they also experienced adverse psychosocial outcomes. There is a need to focus on enhancing strategies such as psychosocial support for healthcare workers and those that overall strengthen the health system to protect healthcare workers, promote resilience and guide recommendations for interventions during future outbreaks.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

N2  - During three years of the unprecedented, massive COVID-19 pandemic that affected the world, nurse front liners faced substantial challenges and experienced long-term adverse mental health. This study explored psychological self-care practices undertaken by nurses to strengthen their mental health and develop resilience in their professional care role while addressing the challenges of the COVID-19 era. A qualitative descriptive exploratory study was conducted on 40 nurses who worked in providing COVID-19 care across Brunei using focus groups aided by semi-structured open-ended questions. Data were thematically analyzed using constructivist grounded theory. Four themes emerged: (1) 'Care of the mind, heart and soul'; (2) 'Physical care for the psychological well-being'; (3) 'Venting out and distraction'; (4) 'Have faith, think and stay positive'. The challenges of dealing with a worldwide pandemic unintentionally placed nurses' mental well-being at risk while the government strategized and prioritized containing and preventing the spread of and death from COVID-19. Health administrators, as well as nursing educators, need to promote and develop resources to strengthen nurses' psychological self-care practices. This will not only benefit individual nurses but will help promote the well-being of patients and employees, improve the health of all, and counteract any unintended stressful situations, even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

N2  - Education, with an emphasis on prison health, has acted as a policy inducing changes in work processes, which the Brazilian National Health System (SUS) has used, and which is present in permanent health education, which promotes health care for people deprived of liberty. This article aims to present an analysis of the impacts of the strategy of massive education on prison health in Brazil from the perspective of health professionals and other actors operating in the Brazilian prison system. The data used in the study come from a questionnaire consisting of 37 questions applied nationwide between March and June 2022. Responses were collected from students who completed the course "Health Care for People Deprived of Freedom" of the learning pathway "Prison System", available in the Virtual Learning Environment of the Brazilian Health System (AVASUS). This course was offered nationally, whose adhesion (enrollment) occurred spontaneously, i.e., the course was not a mandatory. The data collected allowed us to analyze the impacts of massive education on prison health. The study also shows that the search for the course is made by several areas of knowledge, with a higher incidence in the health area, but also in other areas, such as humanities, which also work directly with the guarantee of the rights of people deprived of liberty, which are professionals in the areas of social work, psychology, and education. The analysis based on the data suggests that the massive education mediated by technology through the courses of the learning pathway, besides disseminating knowledge-following the action plan of the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)-, are an effective tool to promote resilience in response to prison health and care demands of people deprived of liberty.Copyright © 2023 Valentim, Dias-Trindade, Oliveira, Romao, Fernandes, Caitano, Bonfim, Dias, Gusmao, Morais, Melo, Fontoura de Souza, Medeiros, Rego, Ceccim and Valentim.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To conduct a single-arm prospective pilot study examining the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a Stress Management and Resiliency Training (SMART) intervention among family caregivers (FCGs) of individuals with head and neck cancer (HNC). SAMPLE &AMP; SETTING: This study was conducted with 26 FCGs of individuals with HNC receiving chemotherapy in the medical oncology clinic at the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. METHODS &AMP; VARIABLES: The SMART intervention consisted of in-person and online components. Measurements included feasibility, acceptability, self-compassion, resilience, perceived stress, anxiety, and mindfulness. RESULT(S): Results support acceptability of the SMART program and provide recommendations to improve feasibility. Data indicate significant improvements in self-compassion (p = 0.03) and anxiety (p = 0.02), with positive trends for resilience, stress, and mindfulness. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: This study warrants further research with larger, more diverse samples testing the efficacy of the program, its mechanism of action, and potential synergistic effects among individuals receiving oncology care, FCGs, and nurses.

SAMPLE &AMP; SETTING: A cross-sectional study of 117 colorectal cancer survivors was conducted at a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. METHODS &AMP; VARIABLES: Participants completed a demographic questionnaire, and the Carver Benefit Finding Scale and Posttraumatic Growth Inventory assessed positive psychology. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analyses were performed. RESULT(S): 49 symptoms were reported and varied based on prior trauma. Significance was found between positive psychology and symptom frequency (p < 0.001); symptoms reported almost daily and daily were inversely related to positive psychology. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should prioritize symptoms; less frequent symptoms improve positive psychology. Early identification of positive changes may promote survivors' self-awareness and management skills to mitigate adverse symptoms.

N2  - Background/Rationale or Objectives/Purpose Many lung cancer patients experience Fear or Anxiety about the Recurrence of Lung Cancer (FARLC). Extant research on cancer suggests that support for FARLC is the most significant and unmet need. We aimed to assess which types of support are needed and desired and to what extent lung cancer patients' needs are being met. Methodology or Methods Together with the Canadian Lung Cancer Advocacy-Breathe Hope, a purposedesigned questionnaire was distributed online via e-mail, newsletters and social media in Canada. All questions were multiple-choice. Impact on Practice or Results Out of 121 respondents, 119 had experienced FARLC and were included in the present study. While over 82% of respondents reported having access to mental healthcare services, 67% of patients reported that they were never referred to mental health services by their oncology team. The most important coping strategies were (1) talking to someone about FARLC (71%), (2) distracting oneself with enjoyable activities (61%), and (3) gaining practical tips on dealing with FARLC (50%). The most influential systems of support identified were patient support groups online and in person (65%), psychologists/therapists within the hospital/cancer care centre (47%), and friends, family and co-workers (42%). Discussion or Conclusions Most lung cancer patients reporting FARLC indicated a need for more support, but the majority are not receiving information or referrals for mental health support from their oncology care teams. Many patients rely on patient support groups, friends and family for support. Serious gaps in the mental health support available to lung cancer patients need to be addressed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the status quo and key influencing factors of family resilience in cancer treatment. METHOD(S): Eight electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, CNKI, Wan Fang Database, VIP Database) were searched from 2000 to 10 May 2023. Inclusion criteria were the following: (a) study subjects were cancer patients or their family caregivers, (b) family resilience was measured as a variable, (c) reported factors associated with family resilience, (d) employed either quantitative or mixed methods design, (e) written in English or Chinese, (f) published in peer-reviewed journals. All included studies were evaluated for quality using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. RESULT(S): Thirty studies were included in the systematic review. According to our analysis, the family resilience of cancer patients could be influenced by various factors associated with six clusters: (a) demographic characteristics, (b) severe staging and treatment of cancer, (c) psychological and health statuses, (d) family, and (e) social environment. Meanwhile, several specific protective factors and risk factors of family resilience were also identified. CONCLUSION(S): Family resilience plays an important role in promoting positive adaptation in the face of adversity in families of cancer patients/caregivers. This study classifies related influencing factors by analyzing both protective factors and risk factors (and some controversial factors of family resilience). We found that longitudinal studies are needed to further verify the dynamic changes of family resilience, and future research should focus on understanding family resilience from the dual perspectives of cancer patients and their caregivers, to provide comprehensive information for health professionals, and facilitate the development of effective family resilience intervention programs.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Expedition of mass vaccination scheme is the only way to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare professionals have a key role in shaping public opinion about vaccines and are at a higher risk of being infected. Especially dentists, perform duties not only in close contact but with aerosol and droplets that come out of a patient's oral cavity. Objective(s): To appraise the awareness concerning COVID-19 vaccination among dental surgeons and explore the potential drivers for their acceptance levels. These particulars are crucial for formulating new schemes and policies to cope with such emergency situations in near future. Study design: Online cross-sectional study Setting and duration: Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faisalabad Medical University, Faisalabad. May 2021 to June 2021. Material(s) and Method(s): A self-organized questionnaire was conducted among 250 dentists. The questionnaire was designed in the manner to access their knowledge, attitude and perception regarding COVID-19 vaccination. The questionnaire contains a set of 20 questions. The questionnaire was distributed through an online survey link. The results were obtained and statistically analyzed through SPSS software and results were presented in percentages and frequencies. Result(s): We analyzed 216 questionnaires completed by dental surgeons (male: 35.6%; female: 64.5%). Of the participants 80.5% considered that COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective and 62% believe that it does not cause long term health problems.72% considered the overdose of vaccination to be harmful whereas 88% agreed upon importance of vaccine for protection of people and were willing to recommend vaccine for relatives and friends. 63% participants consider pharmaceutical companies are developing safe vaccines and just over half of the participants consider Pak-Vac vaccine to be safe. Finally, 78.7% respondents were satisfied on government strategies regarding COVID-19 vaccination and 95% think that government should provide COVID-19 vaccination for all citizens free of cost. Conclusion(s): The current study declares meager knowledge but more definite attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccinations among dental surgeons at a tertiary care setup. The conclusion suggest that health education programs and more precise information should be delivered and publicized by respective health authorities to abolish the vaccine hesitancy.Copyright © 2022 EManuscript Technologies.

N2  - Background: Prevention of infectious diseases among children is crucial to improve child health and survival. However, many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa struggle to achieve vaccination targets due to supply chain challenges, which lead to vaccine shortages, stockouts, and increased costs. We evaluated the effects of aerial logistics (centralized storage and delivery by drones) on vaccine stock, stockouts, vaccination coverage and vaccine preventable outcomes in the Western North Region of Ghana. Method(s): The study combined retrospective quasi-experimental and cross-sectional designs to evaluate supply chain, programmatic, and clinical outcomes. Surveys to health providers were used to collect information from a random sample of 156 facilities, and secondary data on vaccination coverage and clinical outcomes was analyzed at the district level for the years 2017-2021. Result(s): Facilities served by aerial logistics reported significant reductions in the duration of vaccine stockouts (30 %, p-value < 0.05), as well as in the frequency of missed opportunities for vaccination (44 %, p-value < 0.05). Being served by aerial logistics was associated with increased satisfaction with access to vaccines. Significant differences in vaccination coverage were found for most vaccines, in a range between 13.1 and 37.5 percentage points in vaccination coverage for served districts. Infectious diarrhea cases in children between 5 and 9 years old were reduced by 41.6 % (p-value < 0.05). Conclusion(s): End-to-end aerial logistics appears as an effective tool to improve the performance of the supply chain for vaccines. The strategy potentially increases the resilience of the health system and contributes to increased vaccination coverage and higher levels of satisfaction among providers in the Western North Region of Ghana.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s)

N2  - Firefighters are repeatedly exposed to work-related potential traumatic events and have an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the mechanisms implicated in this relationship are not clear. The aim of this study was to analyse the risk and protective factors related to the development of PTSD in firefighters. According to PRISMA, a systematic review of scientific literature was conducted in Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) was used as the methodological quality indicator of the selected articles (PROSPERO reference CRD42020213009). Prognostic studies involving active firefighters with presence of post-traumatic symptomatology, presenting original findings, and written in Spanish or English were included. A total of 1768 potentially eligible articles were identified. According to the inclusion criteria, 87 articles were selected to evaluate the full text. Finally, 19 articles were included, comprising 12,298 active firefighters. There is high heterogeneity in the variables evaluated in the different studies. Taking the data for which this review has found more evidence (moderate support), operational stress, job duration, burnout, expressive suppression and rumination could be risk factors of PTSD, and belongingness and dispositional mindfulness could be protective factors. Other variables with weak support (e.g. resilience) were analysed. This review analyses the available literature, highlighting its scarcity for future research on the subject. Due to repeated trauma exposure, it is important to continue investigations and bear these variables in mind for the prevention of PTSD in firefighters.

N2  - Objectives Resilience is becoming an increasingly vital factor for children globally to develop, especially due to the increase in adverse childhood experiences and rates of mental illness. This abstract highlights the pertinent changes that healthcare professionals can implement into their own practice to support the healthy mental development of their patients. Methods This research was conducted via a review of the available literature pertaining to childhood resilience and the most influential contributing factors. This was done by utilising a variety of key terms on medical databases-namely MEDLINE and Cochrane-and selecting sources that met predetermined standards, such as publication within the past ten years. Results The factors discovered which contributed most to the development of childhood resilience were categorised into three groups. Namely, relationships with caring adults; self-regulation and emotional regulation; and agency and self-efficacy. In terms of relationships with caring adults, it was found that the relationships a child develops with parents, teachers, and other guardians had a significant impact on child well-being and promoted prosocial behaviours; whilst the reverse was also found to be true. From a healthcare professional perspective, the mindset and wellbeing of paediatric patients can be improved both directly, by means of engaging with the child in a compassionate manner, and indirectly, through parental education. Self-regulation and emotional regulation also proved a major contributor to successful child development, where it was found that emotional regulation abilities had a significant correlation with improved resilience and executive function. Paediatric practitioners have the ability to promote these skills via regular engagement and conversation, modelling self-regulation themselves. Agency and self-efficacy in children also have significant ties to resilience levels, and increasing children's autonomy in healthcare settings has a measurable positive impact on coping with and recovering from their illness. Healthcare staff are able to promote agency by actively involving the child in their healthcare decisions, regardless of the outcome. Conclusion Resilience is a vital skill for children (especially hospitalised children) to develop, and there are tools available for health practitioners to utilise to promote this skill. Proper engagement with the patient, as well as involvement in their own care and parental education are major contributors which are often under-appreciated in practice. This highlights a further need for education surrounding changes to the way staff practice paediatric healthcare, alongside further information on the necessity of fostering resilience amongst paediatric patients in the modern age.

T1  - THE RETURN OF HUNGER AFTER BARIATRIC-METABOLIC SURGERY
T3  - 26th World Congress of the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders, IFSO 2023. Naples Italy.
A1  - Fallon F. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Background Bariatric-metabolic surgery is a commonly used treatment for severe obesity. It leads to substantial weight loss and improves comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. However, despite the success of the surgery, a small proportion of patients experience weight regain, which may be accompanied by the return of hunger. Understanding the lived experiences of patients who undergo bariatric-metabolic surgery is important for clinicians and patients alike. Objectives This study aimed to explore the return of hunger among patients who underwent bariatric-metabolic surgery at a private hospital in Ireland. The study sought to understand the factors contributing to the return of hunger and how patients coped with this experience. Methods A qualitative approach was used, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 patients who underwent bariatric-metabolic surgery at the private hospital in Ireland one year prior to the study. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was conducted using a thematic analysis approach. Results The findings of the study revealed that the return of hunger was a common experience among the participants. The participants attributed the return of hunger to factors such as emotional eating, stress, and lack of support. The participants coped with the return of hunger by seeking support from healthcare professionals, family and friends, and by adopting new coping strategies. Conclusion The findings of this study highlight the importance of addressing the return of hunger after bariatric-metabolic surgery. Healthcare professionals need to provide ongoing support and education to patients to help them cope with the return of hunger. This study also emphasizes the importance of incorporating psychological support into the post-surgical care of bariatric-metabolic patients. Finally, this study suggests that further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of mindfulness and other coping strategies in managing the return of hunger after bariatric-metabolic surgery.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened mental health among health workers around the world. With a projected global shortage of 10.2 million health workers by 2030, further exacerbated by COVID-19, taking action to support health worker mental health needs to be an integral component of investments to overcome this gap and build resiliency of systems for the future. Health workers are functioning in highly stressful environments at great personal risk to provide services that improve quality of life and save lives. To reduce burnout and early exits from the workforce, health workers must be protected and equipped to work in supportive environments, manage stress, and access mental health services when needed. This article explores the impact of COVID-19 on health worker mental health and proposes actions for health systems and workplaces to support health workers which draw on available evidence and examples of USAID-supported partner activities.Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

N2  - Background: Pain is a significant problem for many people with advanced disease or a serious illness. Culture and ethnicity can affect the experience and management of pain. However, there is limited research in South Asian communities in the UK on their experiences of pain. The aim of this study is to explore the experiences and attitudes of patients and family carers from South Asian communities about pain and its management within advanced disease or serious illness. Method(s): Qualitative thematic analysis based on descriptive phenomenology (Sundler et al. 2019). Qualitative semi-structured interviews with patients or family carers from South Asian communities (N = 15). Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using an inductive approach. Public and Patient Involvement representatives from British South Asian communities were consulted for guidance. Result(s): There were five key themes from the interviews: The importance of communication about pain with healthcare professionals; Concerns about taking pain medication; Personal resilience, privacy and self-management; Gender, culture and pain; Home pain management as struggle and frustration. Conclusion(s): To improve pain management for people from South Asian communities with advanced disease or a serious illness, there are a number of important issues for healthcare professionals from palliative and primary care services to address. These include: greater awareness around people's fears and concerns about pain medication; their potential use of alternative pain management strategies; and cultural issues such as resilience, privacy, dignity and gender roles. Effective communication between doctors, patients and family members could be improved by using a 'cultural humility' model; providing clear and accessible pain medication information; understanding and taking account of people with both low, and medium levels, of English language proficiency; and improving patient trust. Additionally, improvements to out of hours services could improve pain management for all patients managing their pain at home.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - Burnout and resiliency are significant challenges among health care workers. Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) has shown to improve patient-level outcomes; however, AAT research involving hospital staff is limited. Our novel Medical Dog ("MD") Office Hours Program aimed to provide support to pediatric hospital staff and explore the program's impact on burnout. Participant surveys described work role and years of experience, well-being, and emotional/physical descriptions and symptoms. Of 149 participants, 85% endorsed baseline distress/burnout; nearly half had at-risk Well-Being Index scores. Compared with baseline, postintervention participants endorsed significantly fewer negative (more positive) emotions; greater feelings of comfort and energy; and decreased tiredness and pain (P <.0001). Readiness to return to work scores were high (M = 78.1, SD = 18.4). Our Medical Dog ("MD") Office Hours Program resulted in improvements in emotional descriptions and physical symptoms among pediatric health care staff. Leveraging AAT among health care staff may help mitigate burnout and increase resiliency.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Background: This study aimed to reduce the unprecedented and intense psychological distress that nurses were forced to experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. A Chinese version of the World Health Organization's Self-Help Plus (SH+) intervention guide was adapted and tested among nurses. The objective of this study was to translate and adapt the SH+ guideline into the Chinese version and to test its feasibility in reducing psychological distress among nurses during COVID-19. Method(s): A staged approach comprising translation, adaptations, initial evaluation by pilot implementation, and a qualitative process evaluation was conducted in two hospitals in Xi'an, China. The translation of the Chinese version was authorized by the World Health Organization. We adapted SH+ for use among clinical nurses working during the pandemic in China through a qualitative process evaluation, which was guided by the descriptive phenomenological study design. The outcomes of the pilot included psychological distress, psychological flexibility, depressive and anxiety symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and subjective psychological wellbeing, which were assessed using the Kessler 6 symptom checklist, the Comprehensive Assessment of ACT Process (CompACT), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), and the Index of Wellbeing (IWB), respectively. Result(s): The SH+ materials, including audio-recorded sessions and an accompanying illustrated manual, were translated into Chinese and adapted in line with feedback from the nurses. An uncontrolled pilot study (n = 28) for 5 weeks showed a statistically significant reduction of psychological distress (mean difference in Kessler 6 score, -2.74; 95% CI [-3.71, -1.78]; p < 0.001). We also found improvements in psychological flexibility (mean difference in CompACT score, 6.89; 95% CI [-12.35, -4.47]; p < 0.001), subjective psychological wellbeing (mean difference in IWB score, 0.86; 95% CI [0.07, 1.65]; p < 0.05), and depressive symptoms (mean difference in PHQ-9 score, -1.52; 95% CI [-2.78, -0.26]; p < 0.05). The process evaluation showed that nurses found the SH+ program very useful but difficult to adhere to. Conclusion(s): We found that the translated Chinese version of SH+ was applicable and feasible in the Chinese cultural context. There was a potential effect of adapted SH + in reducing nurses' psychological distress during COVID-19 and suggested the value of exploring strategies to increase adherence to the program.Copyright © 2023 Tian, Sun, Jiang, Guo, Huang, Wang, Rahman, Li and Yang.

N2  - Substance use disorders and feeding and eating disorders (FEDs) often manifest in early adolescence, are difficult to treat, and tend to co-occur. Despite their co-occurrence, little is known about their shared risk factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted to compare standardized measures of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and protective factors among 90 adolescents and young adults seeking outpatient treatment for either opioid use disorder (OUD) or an FED. These were assessed using the Modified Adverse Childhood Experience Survey and Southern Kennebec Healthy Start Resilience Survey. Reported ACEs were high in both groups compared with the national average, and those with OUD were more likely to endorse >=4 resilience factors. Meanwhile, the prevalence of emotional neglect, household mental illness, and peer victimization/isolation/rejection was similar between groups. Opioid use disorder patients were also less likely to endorse >=9 resilience factors. Health providers should be mindful to assess for trauma and resiliency in both these populations.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Nursing students' stress, protective factors (e.g. resilience, social support, mindfulness and self-efficacy) and psychological well-being (PWB) have been well reported in the literature. However, the interactions of these variables were scarcely examined in the latter part of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the context of a developing country. This cross-sectional correlational study complying with STROBE guidelines tested a hypothetical model of the interrelationships of nursing students' stress, protective factors and PWB using structural equation modelling (SEM). Nursing students (n=776) from five nursing schools in the Philippines were conveniently recruited from September 2022 to January 2023. Six validated self-report scales (Perceived Stress Scale, Multi-dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, and Psychological Wellbeing Scale) were used to collect data. SEM, mediation analyses and path analyses were used for data analysis. The emerging model demonstrated acceptable model fit parameters. Stress negatively impacted protective factors, while all the protective factors positively influenced PWB. Social support mediated the influence of stress on resilience, mindfulness and PWB. Resilience is a significant mediator of stress, self-efficacy, social support and PWB. Mindfulness mediated the influence of stress, social support and self-efficacy on PWB. Finally, self-efficacy had a mediating role between resilience and mindfulness. Nursing institutions and nurse educators can use the proposed model as their basis for empirical and theoretical evidence in creating programmes that will strengthen nursing students' protective factors, thus reducing stress while improving PWB and learning outcomes.Copyright © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

N2  - Non-suicidal self-harm has been increasing in young people over the last decade leading to several self-help interventions being developed. Self-help toolkits are given a variety of names, such as 'hope box' and 'self-soothe kit', but all seek to provide young people with the tools to manage thoughts to self-harm by bringing together a collection of personal items, distress tolerance activities and help-seeking prompts. They represent a low-cost, low-burden and accessible intervention. This study explored what child and adolescent mental health professionals working with young people are currently recommending as the content of these self-help toolkits. A questionnaire was sent to child and adolescent mental health services and residential units across England and received 251 responses from professionals. Sixty-six per cent described self-help tool kits as being effective or very effective for helping young people manage self-harm urges. The content was categorized into sensory items (subcategorized by sense), distraction activities, relaxation and mindfulness activities, seeking positives and coping strategies, with the caveat that all toolkits should be individualized. The results of this study help to inform the future manualization of the use of self-help toolkits in clinical practice as a self-harm intervention for children and young people.Copyright © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to analyse the impacts of international economic sanctions on the overall health status of Iranians and the health system performance of Iran, in addition to identifying effective strategies for making the health system resilient to sanctions. STUDY DESIGN: A scoping review. METHOD(S): Three databases and grey literature were reviewed, and additional papers were identified in the lists of references. Two authors reviewed papers to check duplications and screen through inclusion/exclusion criteria. Furthermore, a narrative approach was employed to synthesise the findings. RESULT(S): Given overall health impacts, economic sanctions are believed to have adverse effects on Iranian's health and cause significant financial hardships in accessing healthcare services. These hardships mostly affect those in marginalised and vulnerable groups. Economic sanctions degrade Iran's health system by negatively impacting health services' availability. The detrimental effects of sanctions on economic and social circumstances were also documented. Economic sanctions could also adversely affect health research and education. Most strategies identified for health system resilience to sanctions are related to the health system governance. CONCLUSION(S): Even if essential medicines and supplies are exempted from the sanction regime, the impact of economic sanctions on public health is unavoidable. The quantification of the effect economic sanctions on different health-related areas needs by further research. The measures identified for dealing with sanction can be considered in other countries but more work is needed to explore how health of people can be resilient against negative consequences of sanctions.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Background: The 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus outbreak in Korea led to profound emotional and social burdens, especially in patients and health care professionals. Material(s) and Method(s): Focus group interviews were conducted with 2 patients, 1 family member and 6 health care professionals about psychological distress related to MERS in 2017 and analyzed the interview data using the consensual qualitative research method. Result(s): Four domains and 17 core ideas were identified within three interview groups, including psychological distress during the outbreak, problems regarding the response to the outbreak, positive experiences, and future directions for enhancing intervention to improve mental health and prevent psychosocial problems during the outbreak. Psychological consequences were affected by the characteristics of the emerging infectious disease and the structure and process of institutional or governmental response to the MERS outbreak. Mental health services and psychosocial support reduced the negative impact on psychological distress. Conclusion(s): The MERS outbreak in 2015 gave rise to emotional and social injuries to patients and health care professionals, some of which can be long-lasting constraints in their lives. Preparedness in a society's response to a pandemic considering mental health in related parties can minimize negative psychological consequences and enhance resilience at the individual and society levels.Copyright © 2023 by The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, Korean Society for Antimicrobial Therapy, and The Korean Society for AIDS.

N2  - Among people living with HIV (PLWH), 50% report substance use disorders (SUDs), and 30-61% report posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Comorbid PTSD/SUD/HIV has been linked to faster HIV progression and twice the rate of death, lower medical adherence and retention, and increased viral load compared to PLWH without co-occurring PTSD or SUD. A critical first step in establishing comprehensive mental health services for PLWH is the implementation of an evidence-based screening protocol for PTSD and SUDs to facilitate referrals to specialty mental health providers. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, this mixed-methods study aimed to examine the feasibility of delivering the REACH (Resiliency, Engagement, and Accessibility for Comorbid HIV/PTSD/SUD populations) Screening protocol. Three case managers were instructed to provide the REACH screening electronically to all patients that they saw for enrollment or re-enrollment appointments over 3 months (n=102). Of the 70 patients who completed the screener, 27% had clinically significant PTSD symptoms and 48.6% had SUD concerns. Qualitative feedback revealed themes related to beliefs about SU and PTSD, attitudes toward screening, comfort in the discussion of SU and PTSD, and referral and treatment considerations. Discussion includes lessons learned for implementation of this assessment of PTSD/SUD in PLWH as a novel approach to increase mental health engagement and promote health equity, with the potential long-term impact of improving HIV care outcomes via ameliorating mental health/SUD, and implications for prevention of HIV transmission. Implementation science can be leveraged to understand the gap in the utilization of existing evidence-based screening tools in HIV care settings.Copyright © 2023.

T1  - Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management (Health EDRM): WHO initiative to promote global collaboration to improve research and evidence
T3  - IUNS 22nd International Congress of Nutrition. Tokyo Japan.
A1  - Kayano R. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - World Health Organization (WHO) has taken initiatives to develop and support the implementation of health emergency and disaster risk management (Health EDRM) by countries and support the implementation of country strategies, the Sendai Framework, International Health Regulations (2005), the Sustainable Development Goals (2015), and Paris Agreement on Climate Change (2016) and other related regional and global frameworks. The Health EDRM Framework, published by WHO in 2019, describes all the functions that are required across multiple disciplines in health and other sectors that reduce hazards, vulnerabilities, and exposures, while ensuring effective preparedness and readiness, response, and recovery to save lives, protect health and build community and country resilience. Evidence and research play vital roles in advancing all aspects of Health EDRM including understanding community risks, informing the design and delivery of health and related services, health workforce development and monitoring and evaluation. In order to improve the scientific evidence for Health EDRM and promote global and regional collaboration among researchers and experts, WHO established the WHO Thematic Platform for Health EDRM Research Network (Health EDRM RN) in 2018. The Health EDRM RN has supported the setting of key research themes which has informed WHO Health EDRM research funding over the past 3 years, and the publication of the WHO Guidance on Research Methods for Health EDRM in 2021, which was developed through the collaboration among over 100 global experts. In the context of identifying and applying the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and other emergencies and disasters, the Health EDRM RN will continue to strengthen multidisciplinary including nutritional science and multi-sectoral collaboration, Health EDRM research capacities and translating the evidence base into policy and practice. In view of the progress made by the Health EDRM RN and the shifting global situation, two major projects are underway: the 2nd phase of the WHO Health EDRM Knowledge Hub the elaboration of research priorities for Health EDRM. The opportunity to provide wider understanding of the WHO Health EDRM policy, practice and several advanced research areas is important for disaster risk management. The WHO Health EDRM Research Network provides effective multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral collaboration for engagement in development of policy, practice and research. An opportunity to join the Research Network is shared.

N2  - Introduction: Background: During the pandemic, health professionals had the unprecedented experience of dealing with a newdisease with high contagiousness and mortality. The workload, but also the fear of disease management, caused significant levels of stress. Each employee managed stress in his own way. This study detects the level of stress experienced by health workers during the pandemic and the coping strategies they selected accordingly. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to investigate the coping strategies used by health professionals during the pandemic of coronavirus. Method(s): The sample comprised 180 health professionals that were working in a public hospital. The data collection tool was an anonymous questionnaire consisting of socio-demographic questions, the Toulouse Scale for coping , and a sub questionnaire to explore health professionals' views on the pandemic. Result(s): Women (73.9%), young individuals (50.6% are up to 35 years old) and TEI graduates (53.9%) predominate in the sample. The sample consisted mainly of nurses (68.3%) and the great majority were contract workers (67%). The most frequently used dimensions were Active focus (Average 3.91/5.00), Acceptance (3.86), Cognitive Control and Planning (3.61) and Social Information Support (3.60). Also, health workers used more often the strategies of Social support (3.45), Control (3.33) and Focus (3.23), while they use the Withdrawal strategy less often (2.25). Finally, respondents used Positive strategies more often (3.54) than negative ones. Conclusion(s): The health professionals in the present study preferred to ask for information and use cognitive and informative strategies more often and, to a lesser extent, they were overwhelmed by their emotions. The strategies of social support, control and focus were used more often, while the strategy of withdrawal was selected less often. Furthermore, positive strategies were used to a greater extent.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised multiple psychological challenges among most healthcare workers, from anxiety to depression, burnout, sleep disorders, and substance use disorders. Thus, the burden caused by this prolonged medical crisis has inevitably drastically lowered the quality of life of the medical staff. In order to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic, healthcare workers resorted to various coping strategies, with better or worse outcomes. Objective(s): The present study aims to identify Romanian physicians' main coping mechanisms and evaluate the role of positive and negative stress-reducing strategies on quality of life. Method(s): A cross-sectional national survey was conducted using a web-based questionnaire among physicians practicing in Romania (n=265). In addition to socio-demographic and professional information, the questionnaire addressed participants' coping mechanisms using the COPE inventory and quality of life with the WHOQOL-Brief scale. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, and multiple linear regressions were used in the statistical analysis. Result(s): In total, 265 physicians consented to their participation in the survey. Of those who responded, 84.5% identified as female, 92.1% had a permanent residence in a urban setting, 63.8% were married and 55.1% attained a master's degree, a PhD diploma or equivalent level of education. The results showed that optimism was higher in male professionals, while avoidance coping was higher in female health professionals. The mean values of QoL subscales were: 74.7+/-18.3 for the general quality of life, 70.8+/-20.7 for health satisfaction, 64.0+/- 14.2 for the physical area, 61.7+/- 16.2 for the psychological area, 61.2+/- 20.3 for the social relationships area and 64.7+/- 12.7 for the environment area. Specific coping mechanisms (emotional venting, behavioral and mental disengagement) were associated with lower quality of life. In contrast, emotion-focused (positive reinterpretation and acceptance), problem-focused strategies (planning, active coping, suppression of competing activities) and humor were associated positively with most QoL subscales scores. Conclusion(s): Our data points to specific protective characteristics and some detrimental factors on physicians' quality of life during the pandemic, with the implication that these factors may be important considerations for mitigating distress and psychiatric disorders for healthcare workers during times of high stress. Concerted initiatives to improve wellness in healthcare workers ought to develop targeted programs to ensure adequate psychological support.

T1  - The association between pregnancy-specific anxiety and fetal malformations: a cohort study
T3  - 31st European Congress of Psychiatry, EPA 2023. Paris France.
A1  - Bouayed Abdelmoula N. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy-specific anxiety is defined as a mental state of a pregnant woman whose concerns are specific to the pregnancy itself, such as fears regarding the pregnancy, delivery, and health of the child. In the perinatal period, anxiety disorders are relatively common and are more common than depressive disorders. These psychiatric concerns can lead to long-term negative effects on pregnancy outcome. On the other hand, when the pregnancy is complicated by the diagnosis of fetal malformations, these concerns are more detrimental to maternal health. Objective(s): This study aimed to determine the association between pregnancy-specific anxiety in pregnant women and the diagnosis of prenatal fetal malformations, through our database of genetic counseling and prenatal diagnoses. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective study on 20 pregnant women who were referred to our genetic counselling. The consultation was piloted during a prenatal genetic exploration and counselling after the second trimester ultrasound diagnosis of syndromic and non-syndromic fetal malformations. Collection and characterization of the psychiatric concerns of the cohort were conducted using the self-reported feelings during the consultation. A conversion of these data using the Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale was possible to assess the pregnancy-specific anxiety level of our patients. Result(s): Results of our study showed that pregnancy-specific anxiety is significantly associated with the discovery of fetal malformations during pregnancies. Depression, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder as well as a specific phobia from the malformed baby were constants as psychiatric concerns. Conclusion(s): Health care providers should pay special attention to pregnancy-specific anxiety. The Arabic translated version of the PASS that has been shown to have adequate validity and reliability must be used in our institutions to screen for the new concept of pregnancy-specific anxiety among all pregnant women in the perinatal phase. Women who experienced the discovery of a malformed fetus and who are facing pregnancy termination due to fetal abnormalities need to have a particular psychological support.

N2  - Introduction: As a result of the wildfire that engulfed Fort McMurray (FMM), Alberta, Canada in May 2016, over 90,000 residents were evacuated from the city. Approximately 2400 homes, or 10% of the housing stock, were destroyed in Fort McMurray. About 200,000 hectors of forest were destroyed by the fire, which reached into Saskatchewan. In the aftermath of a major disaster, a community's infrastructure is disrupted, and psychological, economic, and environmental effects can last for many years. Objective(s): Intensive research was conducted in Fort McMurray five years after the wildfire disaster to determine the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among residents of the community and to determine the demographic, clinical, and other risk factors of probable MDD and PTSD. Method(s): An online questionnaire administered via REDCap was used to collect data in a quantitative cross-sectional study between 24 April and 2 June 2021. Patients were asked to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) in order to assess the presence of symptoms associated with MDD. An assessment of likely PTSD in respondents was conducted using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-C). In this study, descriptive, univariate, and multivariate regression analyses were conducted. Result(s): Out of 249 people who accessed the survey link, 186 completed it (74.7% response rate). There was a median age of 42 among the subscribers. A majority of the sample consisted of 159 (85.5%) females; 98 (52.7%) over the age of 40; 136 (71%) in a relationship; and 175 (94.1%) employed. Our study sample had an overall prevalence of 45.0% (76) of MDD symptoms. The multivariate logistic regression model revealed four variables that were independently associated with MDD symptoms, including being unemployed, diagnosed with MDD, taking sedative-hypnotics, and willingness to receive mental health counseling. A total of 39.6% of our respondents (65) reported having likely PTSD. Three independent variables: received a mental health depression diagnosis from a health professional, would like to receive mental health counseling, and have only limited or no support from familycontributed significantly to the model for predicting likely PTSD among respondents while controlling the other factors in the regression model. Conclusion(s): The findings of this study indicate that unemployment, the use of sleeping pills, the presence of a previous depression diagnosis, and the willingness to seek mental health counseling are significant factors associated with the increase in the prevalence of MDD and PTSD following wildfires. Support from family members may prevent these conditions from developing.

N2  - Introduction: Research findings show that during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) have been subject to increased workload while also exposed to many psychosocial stressors. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to investigate Covid's impact on healthcare professionals' mental health and their coping strategies Methods: The study population consisted of 144 health professionals from health care facilities in Patras. An internet based questionnaire was distributed,which included demographic survey questions and the following three scales: (1) The Psychological Consequences Questionnaire (PCQ) scale, (2) The Kessler Psychological Distress scale (k6) and (3) Toulouse's scale for coping strategies (E.T.C.). Result(s): 144 health care workers participated in the survey, who were basically women (72.2%) and nurses (60%) In terms of psychological consequences, participants felt pressured, stressed (3.12), and sad/depressed (2.78). The most frequently used coping strategies were acceptance (3.44), active focus (3.38), cognitive focus (3.31), cognitive control and planning (3.30), emotional control (3.17), social informational support (3.16) and cooperation (3.15). In contrast, the strategies used to a lesser extent are substance addiction (1.91), emotional focus ( 2.13), denial (2.27) and alexithymia (2.49). Generally, positive strategies (3.11) were chosen to a greater extent than negative ones ( 2.38). Conclusion(s): It is very important for hospital administrations to design specific psychological support programs and encourage health professionals to participate in them in order to manage their fear, anxiety and stress experienced.

N2  - Introduction: For people with mental illness, internalized stigma, also referred to as self-stigma, is characterized by a subjective perception of devaluation, marginalization, secrecy, shame, and withdrawal. It has many adverse effects on individual's psychological well-being and clinical outcomes. The iatrogenic effects it has during psychotherapeutic treatment can significantly reduce utilization of mental health care services, reduce quality of life and increase avoidant coping. Overall, internalized stigma is considered a risk factor for poorer mental health prognosis. Although some interventions have recently been developed to specifically intervene on this target as part of psychological recovery goals over the course of treatment, most clinicians are not yet aware or empowered to correctly address this. Objective(s): Description of a clinical case illustrating the relevance on addressing internalized mental illness related stigma during the recovery process. Method(s): Clinical case report and review of the literature on the subject. Result(s): We present the case of a 47-year-old female patient, C.S., single, graduated in social work (currently unemployed), who was admitted at the Psychiatry Day Hospital, where she was referred by her Psychiatry Assistant because of abulia, social withdrawal and isolation, depressed mood, thoughts of shame, guilt and selfdevaluation and work incapacity. She had been admitted in the Psychiatry ward one year earlier for a first psychotic breakthrough, presenting persecutory and grandiose delusions and auditory hallucinations. After three weeks of inpatient treatment with antipsychotics, a full remission of the symptoms was achieved, without any posterior relapse. Before that first psychotic episode, the patient had been taking anti-depressive medication (escitalopram 20 mg id) for many years, prescribed by her General Practitioner, for mild to moderate depressive symptoms. After being discharged from the Psychiatry ward, C. kept following an outpatient treatment with anti-depressives and behavioural activationbased psychotherapy. She started to believe she was mentally ill and therefore weak, uncapable, and less deserving than her peers or her previous self. These self-stigmatizing ideas were enhanced by the lack of family support and the beliefs that were fostered by her mother, with whom she started to live after the hospitalization. These factors led to a dysfunctional internalization of an illness behaviour, jeopardizing the patient's ability to reach full recovery. Conclusion(s): This case reinforces the importance of targeting mental illness related stigma during the recovery process. Also, involving the family is of extreme importance to achieve support and address shared beliefs and the interchange between social and internalized stigma.

N2  - Introduction: The suicide rate in the elderly population is the highest of all ages in Korea. Suicide prevention programs specialized in the elderly are scarce. Objective(s): We evaluated the effect of the suicidal prevention program named Nae-an-ae (means to love oneself), which was specifically designed for the conditions of the community dwelling elderly. Method(s): The subjects were those who agreed to participate in the Nae-an-ae program among those evaluated as suicide high-risk groups according to the 2021 Jeollanam-do Mental Health Survey. The program consisted of five sessions of simple activities that could be practiced in daily life along with knowledge transfer through education on emotion recognition, stress management, sleep and relaxation, pain and exercise, and depression. This program was conducted by social workers or nurses working at each local community mental health and welfare center. We evaluated the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form Korean Version (GDSSF), suicidal ideation, satisfaction with life scale (SWLS) and brief resilience scale (BRS) which were measured before and after the program and compared them with the control group. Result(s): A total of 276 participated in the program, 226 were in the control group. In the program participating group, the frequency of suicidal ideation was significantly decreased from 36.2% to 11.6% after the program. GDS-SF, SWLS and BRS were significantly decreased in active group than control group. Conclusion(s): These findings showed that Nae-an-ae program was found to affect not only the control of suicide risk factors such as depression but also positive factors such as life satisfaction and resilience.

N2  - Introduction: Nurses are at an increased risk for work-related stress resulting in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They are susceptible due to frequent exposure to traumatic situations providing care for patients. Objective(s): The purpose of this systematic review is to comprehensively review the content and characteristics of intervention programs for reducing the post-traumatic stress of nurses or nursing students, providing a basis for developing a standardized protocol for programs to promote the integrated health of nurses and protect them from stress events in clinical environments. Method(s): This is a systematic review. Participants (P) targeted nurses or nursing students; Intervention (I) included intervention programs for reducing post-traumatic stress; Comparison (C) was control groups provided with usual or no interventions ; and Outcomes (O) referred to changes in physical or emotional reactions toward post-traumatic stress. Two researchers searched four databases including PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE with keywords such as 'nurse,' 'post-trumatic stress disorder,' 'program,' and 'intervention'. A total of 7,523 studies were searched and 10 studies were included for final analysis (Image 1). The Risk of Bias2 (Image 2) and the Risk of Bias for Nonrandomized Study I (Image 3) were used to evaluate the quality the included studies. Result(s): The number of studies is increasing, with four studies published before 2020, and six studies published since, of which three in 2022. Definitions of trauma situations to which nurses are exposed included diverse elements such as patient death, workplace violence, the COVID-19 pandemic, and complex trauma experiences due to working environments. Most studies have provided multiple intervention sessions, which is appropriate considering the characteristics of PTSD. Most studies examined the secondary effects on mental health such as anxiety, depression, and burnout caused by stress rather than evaluating stress itself. The quality of the study was generally highly biased. The risk of bias increased for the two randomized controlled trials in terms of measurement outcomes and outcome description. The other eight nonrandomized studies all included a self-reporting questionnaire of participants, leading to a risk of bias in terms of measurement outcomes. Conclusion(s): Studies have been conducted to confirm the effectiveness of interventions given heightened concerns about PTSD in nurses. However, the concept of the trauma experienced by nurses was not integrally defined, and information on interventions was often limited. Efforts are required to improve the quality of research in terms of experimental study design.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected mental health. However, its impact between different pandemic waves and different populations has been scarcely studied. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to analyze the differences in psychiatric symptomatology between the general population (GP) and health personnel (HP) during the second and third waves of COVID-19 in Mexico. Method(s): 404 participants were included as part of a cross-sectional study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, using an online survey. Second wave covered from September 27, 2020 to April 17, 2021 and the third wave covered from June 6, 2021 to October 23, 2021. GP refers to Mexican residents during the pandemic, and HP includes healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, residents). Sociodemographic data were collected and scales of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder -7), insomnia (insomnia severity index), and post-traumatic stress (Impact of event scale revised) were applied.Wegather information in a database in Excel, for later analysis using IBM SPSS Statics 21. Traditional descriptive statistics for quantitative variables and frequencies for qualitative variables were obtained. Association and statistical correlation were analyzed using Chi2 tests. Result(s): 71.3% of the collected sample were female, mean age 35.5 (sd= 11.6), the 62.5% consisted of health personnel, the majority were single 48.9%, with postgraduate education 48.9%, middle class (97.2%). A higher percentage of symptoms of depression and anxiety was observed in health personnel compared to the general population during the second wave of COVID-19 (33.9% vs. 19.5%, p=0.047; 18.2% vs. 39.3%, p=0.006). However, during the third wave of COVID-19, more depressive, anxious and insomnia symptoms were observed in the general population compared to health personnel (73.9% vs. 44.4%, p=0.020; 73.9 vs. 25.9%, p= 0.000; 43.5% vs. 11.1%, p=0.008) (Figure 1). Conclusion(s): Health personnel presented more depressive and anxious symptoms during the second wave of COVID-19 compared to the general population, however, the results were inverse during the third wave, showing more psychiatric symptoms in the general population with significant differences. This may be due to various factors, including unawareness, fear of the disease, and exposure during the second wave of the pandemic of health personnel. Moreover, long-lasting containment measures could have overwhelmed the GP by the third wave. Our study underscores the importance of addressing HP mental stressors to increase its resilience in similar health crises. (Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction: The ongoing pandemic due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is not only causing casualties amongst patients but is also putting an enormous strain on healthcare workers worldwide, especially those in frontline of the COVID-19. Objective(s): This study examined the influence of pandemic fatigue on physicians' mental health, with resilience as a mediator. Method(s): This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study involving frontline young doctors at two university hospitals of Sfax, Tunisia. The Pandemic Fatigue Questionnaire, Brief resilience scale, Maslach Burnout Inventory and Satisfaction on call duty scale were used to collect data through an online survey. The survey was carried out through an anonymous questionnaire using Google Forms. Collected data was treated on SPSS program to make all the statistical analysis. The level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Result(s): A total of 261 young doctors responded to the online survey. The mean pandemic fatigue score was 25.09 (out of 50). Terminal years of residency experience (beta=0.171, p=0.005), being vaccinated (beta=0.129, p=0.032) and staff inadequacy (beta=0.205, p=0.001) were associated with elevated score of pandemic fatigue. Resilience partially mediated the relationships between (a) pandemic fatigue and different dimensions of burnout (emotional exhaustion (beta=0.337, p<0.0001), depersonalization (beta=0.311, p<0.0001) and personal accomplishment (beta= =0.185, p=0.004) and (b) pandemic fatigue and satisfaction on call duty (beta=-0.137, p=0.03). Conclusion(s): Resilience reduces the effects of pandemic fatigue on young doctors' mental health. Implementing resilience-promoting measures is essential to support physicians' mental health and foster their well-being therefore improves the quality of care provided.

T1  - Developing mental health care of LGBTIQ+ people in Croatia- research review
T3  - 31st European Congress of Psychiatry, EPA 2023. Paris France.

N2  - Introduction: Despite the general awareness of necessity for implementing development of competences in working with LGBTIQ+ people as the obligatory course within the education of mental health professionals, it is still not the educational standard in Croatia. Objective(s): Within the perspective of the past 20 years, the development of educational programs aiming to develop LGBTIQ+ affimrative and informed practice in the field of mental health care, togeather with the review of the most crucial research results in the field of LGBTIQ+ mental health will be given. Method(s): The results obtained from several research on national samples of LGBTIQ+ people, psychology students and psychologists are analysed using mainly qualitative methodology and to the small extent quantitative methodology. Result(s): Psychologists are perceived as a profession that respects diversity and actively reduces stereotypes and prejudice but there are still some obstacles to overcome within the profession. In traditional cultures appreciation of human rights of LGBT people is unfortunately not a guiding principle. Research on Croatian university students showed that slightly positive attitudes toward LGBT people were stable and remained unchanged from the 2005 till 2013. Specific attitudes toward human rights of lesbians and gays are ranging from moderately negative to moderately positive. The most frequent forms of discrimination and/or violating human rights of LGBT people are: usage of offensive, humiliating, pejorative and oppressive language, ignoring of LGBT people, attentional exclusion of LGBT people, threatening with physical violence. Stress resilience, social support, and inclusion in the LGBT society are key determinants of different indicators of mental health in this population. Although 64.4 % of transgender participants are highly informed about the new legalization, only 24.5 % are very satisfied with it. Trans-women, in comparison to trans-men, have significantly lower levels of quality of life and experience significantly higher levels of sexual violence. Based on the online research among the professionals from the Croatian national list of experts in thefield of health care of trans people the percieved level of transphobia in sociaty is abowe the average, as well as percieved impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on acessibility and slowing down of standard diagnostic procedures. Conclusion(s): Significant political and social change for sexual and gender minority people in Croatia in the last several years have contributed to a greater public visibility of LGBTIQ+ people. As allies of LGBTIQ+ people and even as belonging to the LGBTIQ+ population, psychologists, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals have the leading role in ensuring that the results of their scientific findings and professional corpus of knowledge have ethical and practical implementation and beneficial impact on society.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Emergency department healthcare professionals have the most contact with patients in cardiac arrest, and their physical and mental state has a significant impact on the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and patient outcomes. However, there is limited research discussing the experience of resuscitation by emergency department healthcare professionals. AIM: To explore the experiences of emergency department healthcare professionals in performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHOD(S): A descriptive phenomenological study. The study used purposive sampling and selected 9 nurses and 6 physicians from the emergency departments of four general hospitals of different levels in western China between May 2022 and October 2022. Semi-structured interview guides and face-to-face interviews were used to collect information. Colaizzi analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULT(S): The study identified 3 themes and 11 sub-themes. These themes and sub-themes include 1) emotional experience (A sense of achievement, A sense of powerlessness and trauma, Stress, Empathy, Psychological resilience strengthens), 2) cognitive growth (Understanding CPR rationally, Increasing concern for personal and family health, Mastering self-relaxation methods), and 3) the desire for continued development (Seeking professional development, Hoping for professional psychological assistance, Strengthening team support). CONCLUSION(S): The experience of performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation by healthcare professionals in emergency departments is dynamic, with changes in mood and cognitive growth. Managers in hospitals should pay attention to their experiences and need at different stages of career development and actively carry out targeted cognitive guidance, skills training, and psychological support to help them achieve professional development and physical and mental health. At the same time, to promote the development of CPR for all, it is recommended that the authorities actively improve the public infrastructure for first aid and related policy protection.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Health promotion interventions for immigrant health are generally directed toward women and youth. There is no program specific to migrant male in the global and national literature to protect, improve and promote their health. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the Increasing Health Awareness of Immigrant Men (IHAPIM) program on health perceptions, health responsibilities, perceived stress level, attitudes toward utilizing health care services and the types of coping strategies of immigrant male. METHOD(S): Researchers applied the short-term IHAPIM program experimental group for 5 weeks. This study was held in the two districts where predominantly immigrants live. The immigrant male's health perceptions, health responsibilities, perceived stress level, attitudes toward utilizing health care services and the types of coping strategies measured before and after 3 months of the IHAPIM program was performed. RESULT(S): The study results showed that the levels of health perceptions, health responsibilities and the types of coping strategies of immigrant male were significantly different between the two study groups. CONCLUSION(S): At the end of the study, the experimental group showed improvement in measures of the health perceptions, health responsibilities, attitudes toward utilizing health care services, the types of coping strategies and perceived stress level of male decreased. Nursing interventions specific to immigrant male and sensitive to their language have led to positive changes in the health variables of immigrant male.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

T1  - Experiences and coping strategies of women caring for their husbands with cancer at the Cancer Diseases Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia: a descriptive phenomenological approach

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - The Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH) 2019 annual report revealed an upsurge in the number of new cancer patients accessing services from 35 patients in 2006 to 3,008 in 2019. This study explored the experiences and coping strategies of women caring for their husbands with cancer attending the CDH. A phenomenological research design was used with stratified purposeful sampling. Data were collected using an interview schedule and analysed using thematic analysis. The women's challenges included mobility difficulties and hospital admissions/problems; socio-economic problems, psychological and emotional distress; and caregiving liability and spiritual anguish. The benefits that female spouses experienced during caring for their loved ones included knowledge about cancer and infection prevention, a strong marital relationship, tolerance and perseverance, resilience and hope and good relationship with other caregivers. The women's needs included financial support, physical needs, psychosocial counselling, caregiver accommodation, time off from caregiving, information needs and sexual intimacy and contact. Their coping strategies included spiritual support from spiritual carers, prayer and meditation, music and storytelling, social support and a good marital relationship. The findings demonstrate that wives of patients with cancer experience many challenges in their caring journey. Nurses must anticipate and/or intervene as part of their nursing practice to reduce the negative impact on female caretakers in this situation. Hospital standard operating procedures must be developed to put both the patients and their caregivers at the centre of oncology nursing care, particularly in settings with limited allied professional support, e.g., psychologists. Caretaker coping strategies highlighted in this study must be made available for both the patients and their wives, e.g., linking wives to trained spiritual carers upon their husband's admission to the hospital, to aid a smooth caregiving experience.Copyright: © the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.

N2  - Background: Refugees who have fled war zones are at a heightened risk of psychosocial problems that can impact their ability to function in day-to-day life and place a significant burden on the family structure. This study aimed to assess the psychosocial problems and needs and coping mechanisms of Adolescent Syrian refugees in Jordan. Method(s): Between October and December 2018, we conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with a sample of key and individual informants. Our sample included 20 primary healthcare professionals, 20 schoolteachers, 20 Syrian parents, and 20 adolescents aged 12-17 years. All interviews were transcribed verbatim, and we utilized thematic analysis to group, categorize, and analyze the original Arabic language transcripts. To ensure thorough analysis, we adopted a bottom-up inductive approach that covered the six-phase iterative process proposed by Braun and Clarke. Result(s): The main psychosocial problems encountered by Syrian adolescents included stress, depression, loneliness, lack of a sense of security, isolation, aggressiveness, fear of war, and family disintegration. Almost all schoolteachers reported that they observed that Jordanian adolescents are more settled, self-confident, and financially stable relative to their Syrian peers. The Jordanian government and community were praised for their support, including education, recreational centers, health services, and awareness campaigns. Going to school, praying and reading the Holy Quran, listening to music, and talking to friends and engaging with them were reported as the main coping mechanisms. The majority of respondents said that more services are still needed for adolescents, including more places for entertainment, psychosocial support and psychological counseling, medical care, job creation, and providing health insurance. Conclusion(s): Syrian refugees are aware of the psychological aspects of their situation, but they are not always able to access clinic-based humanitarian assistance for mental health and psychosocial support. Stakeholders must interact with refugees to learn about their needs and develop services that are appropriate for their culture.Copyright © 2023 Al-Shatanawi, Khader, ALSalamat, Al Hadid, Jarboua, Amarneh, Alkouri, Alfaqih and Alrabadi.

N2  - Following the surge for empathy training in service literature and its increasing demand in service industries, this study systematically reviews empirical papers implementing and testing empathy training programs in various service domains. A mixed-methods systematic review was performed to identify and describe empathy training programs and discuss their effectiveness in service quality, service employees' well-being, and service users' satisfaction. Included papers met those eligibility criteria: qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods study; one training in empathy is identifiable; described training(s) developed for or tested with service employees dealing with service users. We searched health, business, education, and psychology databases, such as CINAHL, Medline ABI/Inform Global, Business Source Premier, PsycINFO, and ERIC. We used the Mixed-Method Assessment Tool to appraise the quality of included papers. A data-based convergent synthesis design allowed for the analysis of the data. A total of 44 studies published between 2009 to 2022 were included. The narrative presentation of findings was regrouped into these six dimensions of empathy training programs: 1) why, 2) who, 3) what, 4) how, 5) where, and 6) when and how much. Close to 50% of studies did not include a definition of empathy. Four main empathic competencies developed through the training programs were identified: communication, relationship building, emotional resilience, and counseling skills. Face-to-face and group-setting interventions are widespread. Our systematic review shows that the 44 papers identified come only from health services with a predominant population of physicians and nurses. However, we show that the four empathic skills identified could be trained and developed in other sectors, such as business. This is the first mixed-methods, multi-disciplinary systematic review of empathy training programs in service research. The review integrates insights from health services, identifies research limitations and gaps in existing empirical research, and outlines a research agenda for future research and implications for service research.Copyright © 2023 Lajante et al.

N2  - Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has determined an extraordinary challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. The extraordinary circumstances, characterized by elevated stress levels, prolonged working hours, new medical procedures, media attention, and high population expectations, have created an extremely stressful situation for healthcare professionals. This period has offered a unique opportunity to examine the medical system and the responses of healthcare practitioners to stress. This research aimed to identify the work-related factors that significantly impact the mental health of healthcare professionals. Patients and Methods: Three mental health variables were assessed: anxiety, depression and stress. The work-related factors considered were professional degree, type of medical unit (COVID or non-COVID), the number of hours spent at work in a single shift, type of shifts, monthly on-call frequency, and number of COVID-19 treated patients per month. In the spring of 2022, three inventories and a demographic survey were distributed and completed online by 300 healthcare professionals from Timisoara's public hospitals in Romania. Result(s): Among the respondents, 47.7% reported mild symptoms of anxiety, 65.3% reported moderate levels of stress, and 33% of the participants reported mild symptoms of depression. The intensity of anxious, depressive, and stress symptoms varied significantly depending on the professional degree, number of on-calls per month, the type of medical unit where the participants worked, and the number of SARS CoV-2 patients treated in the previous month. Conclusion(s): Current data underlines the urgency of implementing effective strategies to reduce the stress and anxiety of medical practitioners who work with COVID-19 patients. Possible interventions encompass a variety of approaches, such as improving working conditions, reducing working hours where possible, increasing access to mental health services, and promoting team-building activities to enhance social support among colleagues. Digital mental health interventions, including online counseling and stress management programs, have also shown promise in these challenging times. Sustaining the mental health of medical practitioners is vital to support the continued provision of first-rate care to patients and to build a resilient healthcare workforce capable of navigating future health crises.Copyright © 2023 Laza et al.

N2  - Background: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivors often experience several impairments in their physical, cognitive, and psychological health status, which are labeled as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). The aim of this work is to develop a multidisciplinary and -professional guideline for the rehabilitative therapy of PICS. Method(s): A multidisciplinary/-professional task force of 15 healthcare professionals applied a structured, evidence-based approach to address 10 scientific questions. For each PICO-question (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome), best available evidence was identified. Recommendations were rated as "strong recommendation", "recommendation" or "therapy option", based on Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation principles. In addition, evidence gaps were identified. Result(s): The evidence resulted in 12 recommendations, 4 therapy options, and one statement for the prevention or treatment of PICS. Recommendations: early mobilization, motor training, and nutrition/dysphagia management should be performed. Delirium prophylaxis focuses on behavioral interventions. ICU diaries can prevent/treat psychological health issues like anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders. Early rehabilitation approaches as well as long-term access to specialized rehabilitation centers are recommended. Therapy options include additional physical rehabilitation interventions. Statement: A prerequisite for the treatment of PICS are the regular and repeated assessments of the physical, cognitive and psychological health in patients at risk for or having PICS. Conclusion(s): PICS is a variable and complex syndrome that requires an individual multidisciplinary, and multiprofessional approach. Rehabilitation of PICS should include an assessment and therapy of motor-, cognitive-, and psychological health impairments.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: Tobacco use is highly discouraged in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to related short and long-term health implications. We aimed to evaluate smoking cessation patterns in patients with RA. In addition, we ascertained perceptions on the usefulness of quitting methods, and perceived motivators and barriers to quit. Method(s): We surveyed adults with RA enrolled in the FORWARD Databank who self-identified as former or current tobacco users. Result(s): Three hundred forty-eight participants completed the survey and responded to the question "do you currently smoke" (former use = 319; current use = 29). Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was perceived as extremely/somewhat useful by 31%, followed by individual 27% and group counseling 21%. Experiencing a major health event was the most common motivator to quit. Current users on average smoked 17 cigarettes per day. Six of the 29 current users had used electronic cigarettes in the past 30 days. The most frequent methods used to quit were "cold turkey quitting," NRT, and prescription medicines. Only 8 of the 23 current users had plans to quit or expressed being ready to make changes to quit. Reasons most frequently listed to not quit were using smoking to manage negative emotions, as a pleasurable habit, to manage other addictions, and to provide a sense of control (e.g., to cope with RA). Conclusion(s): Current users expressed several negative emotions including coping with the disease and "being a pleasurable habit" when trying to quit. Future cessation programs should address these barriers to support patients with RA. Key Points* First study characterizing the smoking behavior of patients with RA in the USA. Current users were younger, had a shorter disease duration, and worse disease outcomes compared to former smokers.* Former and current users reported similar motivators to quit, with experiencing a major health event being most common. Only about a third of participants who quit or who were still smoking received advice from a health professional.* The most common reasons for not quitting were that smoking help to manage negative emotions and was a pleasurable habit. Future studies should focus on cessation programs that support participants with RA by addressing the unique perceptions about smoking in this population.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).

T1  - The mediating roles of moral courage and moral resilience between nurses' moral distress and moral injury: An online cross-sectional study
A1  - Berdida D.J.E. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - AIMS: To investigate the mediating role of moral resilience and moral courage in the association between moral distress and moral injury. BACKGROUND: There is a preponderance of nursing literature about moral distress, moral resilience, moral courage and moral injury. However, examining moral resilience and moral courage as mediators remain underreported during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the context of a developing nation. DESIGN: Correlational, cross-sectional design compliant with the STROBE guidelines. METHOD(S): A convenience sample of nurses (n = 412) from the Philippines were recruited using social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Messenger, Twitter). Four self-report and validated scales (8-item Moral-Distress Appraisal Scale, 21-item Nurses' Moral Courage Scale, 17-item Rushton Moral Resilience Scale and 10-item Moral Injury Symptom Scale: Healthcare Professionals Version) were used to collect data from January to July 2022. Pearson's r, bivariate analysis and multistage regression analyses were used for data analysis. RESULT(S): This study afforded a model that depicted the interrelationships of moral distress, moral resilience, moral courage and moral injury. Moral distress has a negative impact on moral resilience and moral courage while positively affecting moral injury. Moral resilience positively influences moral courage while having a negative impact on moral injury. Moral courage has an indirect impact on moral injury. Finally, moral resilience and moral courage demonstrated a mediating effect between moral distress and moral injury. CONCLUSION(S): Healthcare organizations, policymakers and nurse managers should include policies and programs that include improving approaches to modifying workplace conditions and evaluating nurses' moral resilience and courage. Nurse managers need to advocate ethics education and professionalism. Nurses must practice self-care strategies to strengthen morally resilient and courageous therapeutic practices.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Health professionals are often faced with the need to identify women at risk of manifesting poor psychological resilience following the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to support clinical decision support (CDS) tools in helping health professionals identify women who are at risk of adverse well-being outcomes and plan customized psychological interventions for women at risk. Clinical flexibility, cross-validated performance accuracy, and model explainability permitting person-specific identification of risk factors are highly desirable features of such tools. Objective(s): This study aimed to develop and cross-validate machine learning models designed to identify breast cancer survivors at risk of poor overall mental health and global quality of life and identify potential targets of personalized psychological interventions according to an extensive set of clinical recommendations. Method(s): A set of 12 alternative models was developed to improve the clinical flexibility of the CDS tool. All models were validated using longitudinal data from a prospective, multicenter clinical pilot at 5 major oncology centers in 4 countries (Italy, Finland, Israel, and Portugal; the Predicting Effective Adaptation to Breast Cancer to Help Women to BOUNCE Back [BOUNCE] project). A total of 706 patients with highly treatable breast cancer were enrolled shortly after diagnosis and before the onset of oncological treatments and were followed up for 18 months. An extensive set of demographic, lifestyle, clinical, psychological, and biological variables measured within 3 months after enrollment served as predictors. Rigorous feature selection isolated key psychological resilience outcomes that could be incorporated into future clinical practice. Result(s): Balanced random forest classifiers were successful at predicting well-being outcomes, with accuracies ranging between 78% and 82% (for 12-month end points after diagnosis) and between 74% and 83% (for 18-month end points after diagnosis). Explainability and interpretability analyses built on the best-performing models were used to identify potentially modifiable psychological and lifestyle characteristics that, if addressed systematically in the context of personalized psychological interventions, would be most likely to promote resilience for a given patient. Conclusion(s): Our results highlight the clinical utility of the BOUNCE modeling approach by focusing on resilience predictors that can be readily available to practicing clinicians at major oncology centers. The BOUNCE CDS tool paves the way for personalized risk assessment methods to identify patients at high risk of adverse well-being outcomes and direct valuable resources toward those most in need of specialized psychological interventions.Copyright ©Georgios C Manikis, Nicholas J Simos, Konstantina Kourou, Haridimos Kondylakis, Paula Poikonen-Saksela, Ketti Mazzocco, Ruth Pat-Horenczyk, Berta Sousa, Albino J Oliveira-Maia, Johanna Mattson, Ilan Roziner, Chiara Marzorati, Kostas Marias, Mikko Nuutinen, Evangelos Karademas, Dimitrios Fotiadis.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to cause enormous psychological burden among health care workers, including first responders. However, the psychological well-being of first responders, essential in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, has often been ignored. This qualitative study aimed to explore the coping strategies used by EMTs to manage stress during the pandemic. Method(s): The research was designed as a qualitative study, utilizing a thematic analysis framework. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 EMTs from a single geographic area between September 2022 and December 2022. The data were analyzed using Braun and Clarke analytic techniques, and this study used Lincoln and Guba's to assess the reliability of the data. Result(s): Four main coping strategies emerged from the data: seeking social support, practicing self-care, utilizing coping mechanisms, and finding meaning and purpose in work. EMTs sought support from both professional and personal sources, engaged in physical and emotional self-care, used humor and distraction as coping mechanisms, and found meaning and purpose in helping others and growing as professionals. Conclusion(s): Based on the extracted results from the study on EMTs in Iran, it can be concluded that the importance of social support cannot be overstated, as it serves as a crucial buffer against the negative effects of stress and trauma. The findings suggest that addressing the social and emotional needs of EMTs is important for promoting their mental health and well-being during the pandemic.Copyright © 2023 Parvaresh-Masoud, Abdollahyar, Molavi-Taleghani, Salahi and Farahmandnia.

N2  - Background: Though the severe prevention and control measures faced by Chinese nurses had changed during the normalisation stage of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, they still worked under great stress. Due to a lack of related evidence, we aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Chinese nurses during the normalisation of COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control measures. Method(s): Using convenience sampling, we recruited 784 nurses in Jiangsu province, China to complete a survey via their mobile devices. We used a demographic questionnaire, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, and The Impact of Event Scale-Revised to collect data and applied binary logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with PTSD. Result(s): The prevalence of PTSD was 26.4%. Married nurses were less likely to experience PTSD than unmarried ones (odds ratio (OR)=0.573; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.33-0.99, P=0.046). Social support (OR=0.96; 95% CI=0.94-0.98, P=0.000) and resilience (OR=0.98; 95% CI=0.97-0.99, P=0.004) were significant predictors of PTSD. Conclusion(s): PTSD remained prevalent among Chinese nurses as COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control measures became normalised, with an incidence rate of 26.4%. Resilience, social support, and marital status were factors associated with PTSD. Chinese hospital management must intervene to improve resilience and social support for nurses to reduce symptoms of PTSD.Copyright © 2023 by the Journal of Global Health. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Historically, efforts to improved healthcare provisions have focussed on learning from and understanding what went wrong during adverse events. More recently, however, there has been a growing interest in seeking to improve healthcare quality through promoting and strengthening resilience in healthcare, in light of the range of changes and challenges to which healthcare providers are subjected. So far, several approaches for strengthening resilience performance have been suggested, such as reflection and simulation. However, there is a lack of studies that appraise the range of existing learning tools, the purposes for which they are designed, and the types of learning activities they comprise. The aim of this rapid scoping review is to identify the characteristics of currently available learning tools designed to translate organizational resilience into healthcare practice. METHOD(S): A rapid scoping review approach was used to identify, collect, and synthesise information describing the characteristics of currently available learning tools designed to translate organizational resilience into healthcare practice. EMBASE and Medline Ovid were searched in May 2022 for articles published between 2012 and 2022. RESULT(S): The review identified six different learning tools such as serious games and checklists to guide reflection, targeting different stakeholders, in various healthcare settings. The tools, typically, promoted self-reflection either individually or collaboratively in groups. Evaluations of these tools found them to be useful and supportive of resilience; however, what constitutes resilience was often difficult to discern, particularly the organizational aspect. It became evident from these studies that careful planning and support were needed for their successful implementation. CONCLUSION(S): The tools that are available for review are based on guidelines, checklists, or serious games, all of which offer to prompt either self-reflection or group reflections related to different forms of adaptations that are being performed. In this paper, we propose that more guided reflections mirroring the complexity of resilience in healthcare, along with an interprofessional collaborative and guided approach, are needed for these tools to be enacted effectively to realise change in practice. Future studies also need to explore how tools are perceived, used, and understood in multi-site, multi-level studies with a range of different participants.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - The identification of factors effecting development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in military populations is important to promote resilience and foster readiness. The current study assessed 785 active duty soldiers on locus of control (LOC) and coping style, both of which have previously been associated with PTSS. Results found that an internal LOC and use of problem focused coping (PFC) were negatively associated with PTSS. An interaction was present, such that the effect of PFC was greatest in those with an external LOC. These findings highlight the protective nature of problem-focused coping strategies in mitigating PTSS among soldiers.Copyright © 2022 The Authors

N2  - Physician burnout is increasing in prevalence and has negative implications for the quality of patient care and the health and wellbeing of physicians. Surveys before the COVID-19 pandemic showed high rates of burnout among breast radiologists, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further increased stress. This article summarizes strategies to combat burnout, including improving individual resilience by increasing mindfulness about handling stress, making goals, and noting personal accomplishments. However, more effective change is likely to occur when there is change at both a personal and an organizational level, which includes identifying the stakeholders in a workplace and determining what changes must occur to increase joy and decrease rates of burnout. Despite the increasing rates of burnout, breast radiologists report high rates of personal career satisfaction. Self-reflection and positive steps to increase joy at work are important in maintaining career fulfillment in these challenging times.Copyright © 2023 Society of Breast Imaging. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: What we teach our (bio)medical students today may differ from the future context under which they will operate as health professionals. This shifting and highly demanding profession requires that we equip these students with adaptive competencies for their future careers. We aimed to develop a framework to promote and facilitate professional development from day one, guided by self-awareness and self-directed learning. APPROACH: Based on self-directed, transformative and experiential learning, patient involvement and teamwork, we developed a 3-year longitudinal personal-professional development (LPPD) program in the (bio)medical sciences undergraduate curriculum to stimulate self-driven professional development in a variable context. Through group meetings and individual coach consultations, students address topics such as self-awareness, self-directed and lifelong learning, collaboration, well-being and resilience. To drive learning students receive extensive narrative feedback on an essay assignment. EVALUATION: Experiences and outcomes were evaluated with questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Students and coaches value personal and professional development in a safe learning environment that encourages self-exploration, diversity and connection. Over time, students show more self-awareness and self-directedness and increasingly apply trained skills, resulting in professional identity formation. Students need more clarification to understand the concept of assessment as learning. IMPLICATIONS: With the generic content of a longitudinal program embedded in a meaningful environment, the personal and professional development of students can be facilitated and stimulated to face future challenges. When translating to other curricula, we suggest considering the complexity of professional development and the time expenditure needed for students to explore, experiment and practice. An early start and thorough integration are recommended.Copyright © 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Objectives Resilience is becoming an increasingly vital factor for children globally to develop, especially due to the increase in adverse childhood experiences and rates of mental illness. This abstract highlights the pertinent changes that healthcare professionals can implement into their own practice to support the healthy mental development of their patients. Methods This research was conducted via a review of the available literature pertaining to childhood resilience and the most influential contributing factors. This was done by utilising a variety of key terms on medical databases - namely MEDLINE and Cochrane - and selecting sources that met predetermined standards, such as publication within the past ten years. Results The factors discovered which contributed most to the development of childhood resilience were categorised into three groups. Namely, relationships with caring adults; self-regulation and emotional regulation; and agency and self-efficacy. In terms of relationships with caring adults, it was found that the relationships a child develops with parents, teachers, and other guardians had a significant impact on child wellbeing and promoted prosocial behaviours; whilst the reverse was also found to be true. From a healthcare professional perspective, the mindset and wellbeing of paediatric patients can be improved both directly, by means of engaging with the child in a compassionate manner, and indirectly, through parental education. Self-regulation and emotional regulation also proved a major contributor to successful child development, where it was found that emotional regulation abilities had a significant correlation with improved resilience and executive function. Paediatric practitioners have the ability to promote these skills via regular engagement and conversation, modelling self-regulation themselves. Agency and self-efficacy in children also have significant ties to resilience levels, and increasing children's autonomy in healthcare settings has a measurable positive impact on coping with and recovering from their illness. Healthcare staff are able to promote agency by actively involving the child in their healthcare decisions, regardless of the outcome. Conclusion Resilience is a vital skill for children (especially hospitalised children) to develop, and there are tools available for health practitioners to utilise to promote this skill. Proper engagement with the patient, as well as involvement in their own care and parental education are major contributors which are often under-appreciated in practice. This highlights a further need for education surrounding changes to the way staff practice paediatric healthcare, alongside further information on the necessity of fostering resilience amongst paediatric patients in the modern age.

N2  - Purpose/Objective(s): In March 2022, a COVID-19 associated lockdown at an intravenous (IV) contrast production facility resulted in global shortages. We report our experience as a comprehensive cancer center navigating the IV contrast shortage through the development of an IV contrast triage team. Materials/Methods: A triage prioritization system was established to serve as a guideline for ordering clinicians to reduce contrast use (Table 1). The triage team reviewed all requests and made final determination based on patient history, treatment plan, prior imaging, possible alternative modalities, and competing requests. Result(s): Our institution performed a median of 194 CT studies per day. Contrast utilization as a percentage of all CTs ordered was approximately 80% prior to the shortage, nadired at 9% during peak shortage, and has since returned to pre-shortage levels. While most requests for contrast were changed to non-contrast by the ordering clinician, 132 requests were reviewed by the triage team. Fifty studies (38%) were approved by the team for contrast administration, 56 (42%) were recommended to be performed without contrast, 15 (11%) for a change in modality, and 11 (8%) were felt suitable for delay. There was overall general concordance between the recommendations of the triage team and studies conducted without significant distributional differences (chi2 = 4.004, two-tailed p = 0.2610). We did not note any instances of patient harm associated with the lack of contrast or from the utilization of an alternative imaging modality. Conclusion(s): The concept of resilience involves the development of system-based practices that allow for sustained operations during periods of sudden change, or loss of critical supplies. The effort to optimally allocate limited supply of contrast was an extensive effort across the organization including from senior leadership, IT, radiology, nursing, physicians, and APPs. Defaulting to an automatic cancelation of contrast requests, followed by review from an interdisciplinary triage team was effective in safely reducing contrast utilization. Decisions made by the team appeared to be sound without any known patient harm.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Aim. The covid-19 pandemic/lockdown had a great impact on Severe Mental Illnesses (SMI) on the following variables: adherence to protective measures, infection, Covid-related psychopathology, stress related symptoms exacerbation, social relationship loss and higher mortality risk. InteGRO, a new effective salutogenic-psychoeducational approach, has been designed to help people with SMI manage their life-stress and achieve personal recovery goals through improved social functioning. Positive outcomes after pandemic/ lockdown in patients trained with InteGRO and also their opinion about its usefulness are discussed. Methods. All above mentioned variables were collected in a 1-year observational study (March 2020-2021) for all patients trained with InteGRO. In April 2021 patients were asked to respond to: an ad hoc semi-structured in-depth telephone interview, the Stress-Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating-Scale, the Personal and Social Performance Scale. Results. 37 people out of 41 underwent the observational study. The overall outcome was good: one patient with asymptomatic infection, 40/41 vaccinated, a very low (2/37) trend of hospital admissions similar to previous years, very high personal and social functioning as well as low level of stress. In the interview, patients answered they found the InteGRO Training very useful, above all the meetings concerning Defining Goal and Problem-Solving. They often felt their desire to socialize was prompted by InteGRO training. Conclusions. These results suggest InteGRO had a good impact on SMI patients to face pandemic/lockdown, with high level of personal and social functioning. They also suggest using structured salutogenic psychoeducational programs in public health services can be useful to promote life-skills to face traumatic events. Further studies are needed to understand the duration of these improvements and outcomes.Copyright © 2022 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l.. All rights reserved.

N2  - AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth interventions to reduce stress and promote mental health in healthcare professionals, and to compare the efficacy of different types of programs (guided vs. self-guided; 'third-wave' psychotherapies vs. other types). BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers present high levels of stress, which constitutes a risk factor for developing mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. eHealth interventions have been designed to reduce these professional's stress considering that the characteristics of this delivery method make it a cost-effective and very appealing alternative because of its fast and easy access. DESIGN: A systematic review of quantitative studies. METHOD(S): A comprehensive database search for quantitative studies was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane (until 1 April 2022). The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA and SWiM reporting guidelines. The quality of the studies was assessed using the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute tools. RESULT(S): The abstracts of 6349 articles were assessed and 60 underwent in-depth review, with 27 fulfilling the inclusion criteria. The interventions were classified according to their format (self-guided vs. guided) and contents ('third-wave' psychotherapies vs. others). Twenty-two interventions emerged, 13 of which produced significant posttreatment reductions in stress levels of health professionals (9 self-guided, 8 'third wave' psychotherapies). Significant effects in improving depressive symptomatology, anxiety, burnout, resilience and mindfulness, amongst others, were also found. CONCLUSION(S): The evidence gathered in this review highlights the heterogeneity of the eHealth interventions that have been studied; self-guided and 'third-wave' psychotherapy programs are the most common, often with promising results, although the methodological shortcomings of most studies hinder the extraction of sound conclusions.

N2  - Introduction: During deployment, soldiers are confronted with potentially morally injurious events. In many cases, these events violate their personal values and belief systems, resulting in feelings of anger, alienation, guilt, and shame. The psychological distress caused by such transgressions is defined as moral injury. It remains unclear to date, which therapeutic interventions are most appropriate for addressing this specific psychological condition. This study examines the effectiveness of value-based cognitive-behavioral group therapy combining elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, spiritual care, and adaptive disclosure therapy. Material(s) and Method(s): This controlled study uses the Compass of Shame Scale to assess symptom severity among participants both before and after a three-week inpatient group therapy regimen for moral injury. An intervention group (n = 45) was compared to a waiting-list control group (n = 40). A one-way between subjects ANOVA was conducted to determine the differences between the two measurement points in the intervention group compared to the control group. A positive ethics vote from the Humboldt University Berlin (Charite) was available (No.EA1/092/15). Result(s): A significant difference was found on the shame-associated maladaptive strategies subscales of attack self (F (1, 83) = 5.942, p = 0.017, Cohen's f = 0,27), withdrawal (F (1, 83) = 8.263, p = 0.005, Cohen's f = 0,32), and attack others (F (1, 83) = 10.552, p = 0.002, Cohen's f = 0,36) of the Compass of Shame Scale between the intervention group and the control group at the p < 0.05 level in the pre- and post-treatment (t1-t2) comparison. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that the special therapeutic focus in cognitive-behavioral group therapy can alter shame-based maladaptive coping behaviors in response to war-related moral injury. This study provides further evidence that therapeutic approaches - through fostering a reconciliatory, compassionate, and forgiving approach toward oneself and others - target the underlying mechanisms of moral injury. Therefore, value-based cognitive-behavioral interventions should be considered as a standard element of trauma care in a military setting. Future studies should further examine such interventions in randomized control trials. It would also be particularly valuable for future studies to include a follow-up time point.Copyright © 2023 Diekmann, Issels, Alliger-Horn, Rau, Fischer, Thiel, Willmund and Zimmermann.

N2  - Background: A significant minority (15-18%) of adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) continue to experience problematic hypoglycemia despite access to structured education in flexible insulin therapy and advanced technologies. Many have impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, now recognised to be associated with significant mental health burden. The HARPdoc trial (Hypoglycemia Awareness Restoration Program for people with problematic hypoglycemia Despite Optimised Care) showed that a group programme focused on cognitions and motivation improved scores for diabetes distress, anxiety and depression compared to BGAT (blood glucose awareness training, which addresses education and behaviours), with similarly reduced rates of severe hypoglycaemia. Method(s): This exploratory study addresses the further impact of these programmes on quality of life and mental health. Quality of life was measured at baseline with EQ-5D-5L and it and service use (Adult Service Utilisation Schedule) were measured at 12 and 24 months after randomised participation to either HARPdoc or BGAT. Result(s): Mean EQ-5D scores rose by 14%, +0.1 HRQoL utility score (HUS), over 24 months in HARPdoc and fell by 1%, -0.007 HUS in BGAT. Use of mental health services after HARPdoc or BGAT was 26 vs 56 contacts with a psychiatrist, psychologist or counsellor in months 0-12 and 1 vs 17 contacts in months 13 - 24 respectively. Conclusion(s): We conclude that HARPdoc reduces previously treatment-resistant severe hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes but also enhances quality of life, whilst reducing use of mental health services. We hypothesise that the psychosocial aspects of HARPdoc increase selfefficacy and coping skills, thereby reducing disease burden and the need to access general and mental healthcare provision.

N2  - AIMS: Given the increasing number of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantations (HSCT) performed world-wide, the increasing likelihood of survival following HSCT, and the profound physical, psychosocial, and emotional impact of HSCT on survivors, their carers and families, it is important to identify factors that may contribute to or support post-traumatic growth (PTG) after transplant. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of PTG in an Australian cohort of long-term allogeneic HSCT survivors and describe associations between PTG and relevant clinical, sociodemographic and psychological variables. METHOD(S): This was a large, multi-centre, cross sectional survey of Australian HSCT-survivors inviting all those transplanted in New South Wales between 2000 and 2012. Respondents completed the PTG Inventory (PTGI), the Sydney Post-BMT Survey, FACT-BMT, DASS 21, The Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) Activity Assessment-Patient Self-Report (Form B), the Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale, and the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Scale. Data was analysed using independent t-tests, one-way analysis of variance, and pearson's correlations, and hierarchical multiple regression adjusted for potential confounders and to ascertain independent associations of explanatory variables with PTG. RESULT(S): Of 441 respondents, 99% reported some level of PTG with 67% reporting moderate to high levels of PTG. Female gender, younger age, complementary therapy use, anxiety, psychological distress and psychosocial care, and higher quality of life were associated with higher levels of PTG. Importantly, we also found that PTG was not associated with either chronic GVHD or post-HSCT morbidity. CONCLUSION(S): In this study - the largest study of PTG in long-term allogeneic HSCT survivors - we found that growth appears ubiquitous, with 99% of survivors reporting some degree of PTG and 67% reporting moderate-high levels of PTG. Importantly, we found no association with GVHD or chronic physical post-HSCT morbidity, or adverse financial, occupational or sexual impacts. This suggests that it is the necessity for and experience of, HSCT itself that foments personal growth. Accordingly, healthcare professionals should be alert to the profound and wide-ranging impact of HSCT - and the degree to which survivor's may experience PTG. Identifying interventions that may assist HSCT survivors cope and building their resilience is of utmost importance.Copyright © 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - BACKGROUND: According to current estimates, the number of people needing care will double in the next 40years. It is expected that between 130,000 and 190,000 additional nurses will be needed by 2030 in Germany. Physical and psychological burdens associated with nursing in long-term care facilities can develop into serious health risk factors and significantly impact occupational factors such as absenteeism, especially when linked to difficult working conditions. However, demands and resources specific to the nursing profession have not been analyzed extensively to preserve and promote nurses' workability and health adequately. OBJECTIVE(S): Our study aimed to examine the extent to which perceived health among geriatric nursing staff in Germany is predicted by personal resources, job demands, and job resources. In addition, we analyzed the impact of different behavior and experience patterns on these relationships. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An observational study was conducted between August 2018 and February 2020 in 48 nursing home facilities with 854 staff members in Germany as part of the project 'PROCARE - Prevention and occupational health in long-term care'. METHOD(S): The survey contained instruments that measure workplace exposure, musculoskeletal complaints, physical and mental well-being, chronic stress, and work-related behavior and experience patterns. In addition, health-related information on physical activity and nutrition was collected. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. RESULT(S): The combined physical and mental workload for geriatric nurses is very high, with 75% showing chronic stress. In the overall model, job and personal resources have a stronger association with mental health than physical health, while job demands have an equal impact on mental and physical health. Coping behavior also plays an important key role that should be assessed and considered. A behavior and experience risk pattern (health-endangering) is more strongly associated with a lower health status than a health-promoting behavior pattern. Results of the multigroup test showed that work-related behavior and experience patterns significantly moderate the relationship between physical health and mental health (chi2=392/p<=.001/df=256/RMSEA=0.028/CFI=0.958/TLI=0.931). Only 43% show a health-friendly coping pattern. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings underline the importance of holistic health promotion, which not only aims at changes at the behavioral level and the development of coping strategies but also takes on the task of reducing the workload and including measures to improve the working climate. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: DRKS.de (DRKS00015241); August 9, 2018. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Healthier coping patterns can benefit geriatric nurses' health. However, this is not a substitute for improving working conditions.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: Post-COVID fatigue significantly limits recovery and return-to-work in COVID-19 survivors. We aimed to assess the effects of physical exercising on post-COVID-19-symptoms, physical/mental capacities and workability within a workplace-health-promotion project in health-care personnel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two HCWs were enrolled in two groups based on Post-COVID-Functional Scale (PCFS) scores: (1) severe (SSG, n=11) and (2) mild (MSG, n=21) symptoms. The participants underwent an eight week exercise intervention program consisting of two supervised resistance exercise sessions per week plus individual aerobic exercise recommendations. Primary outcome-parameter for physical fitness was VO2peak. Further, physical function (6MWT, 30s sit-to-stand test (30secSTS)), mental health (anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), stress (PSS-10), fatigue (BFI), resilience (BRS)), cognitive capacity (MoCA) and workability (WAI) were assessed at baseline, after 4 weeks and after completion of exercise intervention. RESULT(S): VO2peak improved significantly in the SSG by 2.4ml/kg/min (95% CI [1.48; 3.01], adj.p<0.001) and non-significantly in the MSG by 1.27ml/kg/min (adj.p=0.096). Both groups significantly improved their 30secSTS (p=0.0236) and 6MWT (p=0.0252) outcomes in both follow-ups (4 weeks and 8 weeks after inclusion). The SSG improved more than the MSG in VO2peak and 6MWT both after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively, although not statistically significant; findings were vice versa for the 30secSTS. 30secSTS outcomes correlated significantly with mental health outcomes and workability. CONCLUSION(S): Post-COVID exercise intervention improved physical fitness, psychological outcomes and workability in HCWs. Cases with severe fatigue showed higher benefit levels compared to those with mild symptoms. The safe and highly feasible 30secSTS correlated well with physical and mental outcomes and better workability in COVID-19 survivors.Implications for rehabilitationPhysical exercising showed to be an effective intervention method in the rehabilitation of COVID-19 survivors suffering from post-COVID syndrome by positively affecting both physical and mental health.In health care workers suffering from post-COVID syndrome, increases in physical performance are directly related to improvements in work ability.The 30s sit-to-stand test (30secSTS) showed promising results as clinical assessment tool.The results of this study indicate that physical exercising will need to play a large and substantial role over the next years in the rehabilitation of COVID-19 survivors suffering from post-COVID-19-syndrome as it positively affects both physical and mental dimensions of the post-COVID-19-syndrome as well as work ability.

N2  - Nurses support pregnant women in coping with their labor pain. The aim of the quasi-experimental correlational design study was to identify the effect of the nursing support provided on labor pain and birth expectations to primiparous pregnant women. This study was carried out with an intervention (n=51) and control group (n=51) of primiparous women who were in their 37-41 weeks of pregnancy. In the first stage of labor (latent phase-active phase) (3-7 cm dilatation), the following procedures were applied respectively. Focusing, imagery, massage, sacral pressure, and breathing-relaxation-pushing exercises were explained to the pregnant women in the intervention group by the researcher and the exercises were practised one-on-one with them. The control group only received standard care in the ward without any intervention. The population of the study consisted of 102 pregnant women aged 18 years and above who had a vaginal delivery between February 15- August 15, 2018.The data of the study were collected using the Pregnancy Diagnosis Form, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (labor VAS1, post-natal VAS2) to determine the pain level of the participants, and WIJMA Labor Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire Version B to determine their expectations. SPSS 22.0 for Windows was used for the data analysis while frequency and percentage distribution, arithmetic means were calculated. Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal- Wallis test, Spearman correlation analysis were performed. The statistical significance level was accepted as p <0.05. The socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics of the pregnant women in the study were similar. VAS1 was 6.0 1.3 in the intervention group and 6.4 .1 in the control group. VAS2 was 0.9 0,8 in the intervention group and 1.31 1,029 in the control group. Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ) Version B was found to be7.3 14.9 in the intervention group and 117.1 23.9 in the control group. The study results showed that the pregnant women in the intervention group described their labor more positively, that the postpartum perceived pain, fear levels of pregnant women who received nursing support were lowerthanthosewhoreceivedstandardcare.

N2  - As part of an Army pilot program, mandatory annual wellness checks were initiated to introduce individuals to counseling and to support psychological resilience and thriving. The program was evaluated using a cross-sectional survey completed by 7,831 soldiers. Findings revealed that about half of soldiers who reported a wellness check rated the check at least moderately helpful in their professional and personal lives. Participants receiving a wellness check reported being more likely to report willingness to seek help if they were to have mental health problems and to report higher levels of resilience and thriving even after controlling for rank, age, education, months in the unit, and trait negative affect. Participants were also less likely to report stigma-related concerns compared to those who had not received a wellness check. Consistent with theory on the common factors in counseling and the contextual model of psychotherapy (Laska et al., 2014), feeling listened to and learning new skills partially mediated the association between perceived wellness check usefulness and study outcomes, although acquiring a new perspective about problems did not. While not a randomized trial, this evaluation suggests that wellness checks are associated with programmatic goals: improved attitudes toward care seeking, resilience, and thriving. Future work should consider ways to ensure counselors address therapeutic common factors and should use a randomized, longitudinal design. Study findings have implications for implementing programs like wellness checks for military personnel and others working in high-stress occupations like first responders.

N2  - Introduction: Common mental disorders (CMDs) are highly prevalent among people with HIV. Integrating mental healthcare into HIV care may improve mental health and HIV treatment outcomes. We describe the reported availability of screening and treatment for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at global HIV treatment centres participating in the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) Consortium in 2020 and changes in availability at sites in low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) between 2016/2017 and 2020. Method(s): In 2020, 238 sites contributing individual-level data to the IeDEA Consortium and in 2016/2017 a stratified random sample of IeDEA sites in LMICs were eligible to participate in site surveys on the availability of screening and treatment for CMDs. We assessed trends over time for 68 sites across 27 LMICs that participated in both surveys. Result(s): Among the 238 sites eligible to participate in the 2020 site survey, 227 (95%) participated, and mental health screening and treatment data were available for 223 (98%) sites across 41 countries. A total of 95 sites across 29 LMICs completed the 2016/2017 survey. In 2020, 68% of sites were in urban settings, and 77% were in LMICs. Overall, 50%, 14% and 12% of sites reported screening with a validated instrument for depression, anxiety and PTSD, respectively. Screening plus treatment in the form of counselling was available for depression, anxiety and PTSD at 46%, 13% and 11% of sites, respectively. Screening plus treatment in the form of medication was available for depression, anxiety and PTSD at 36%, 11% and 8% of sites, respectively. Among sites that participated in both surveys, screening for depression was more commonly available in 2020 than 2016/2017 (75% vs. 59%, respectively, p = 0.048). Conclusion(s): Reported availability of screening for depression increased among this group of IeDEA sites in LMICs between 2016/2017 and 2020. However, substantial gaps persist in the availability of mental healthcare at HIV treatment sites across global settings, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Implementation of sustainable strategies to integrate mental health services into HIV care is needed.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has disrupted maternal and child health services. Community Health Workers (CHWs) supported the women by visiting pregnant women's homes and providing the MCH services as required. This study attempts to understand the role of CHW and its impact on the Ante-Natal Care (ANC) services pre-pandemic and post-Pandemic in the poor resource setting. METHOD(S): The Swabhimaan programme interventions were carried out in the selected blocks in the Indian States of Bihar, Odisha and Chhattisgarh with the objective to improve the nutritional status of mothers, pregnant women and adolescents living in resource-poor blocks of three selected states during 2016-2022. Cross-sectional surveys, namely pre-pandemic (2018-19) and post-pandemic (2021-22) of pregnant and mothers of under two children, utilised to fulfil the objectives of this study. These surveys are part of Swabhimaan evaluation, a community-based non-randomised controlled study. RESULT(S): The ANC services received by women have increased over time from 2015 to 2022. Our findings confirm that the ground-level community and health systems were active during the pandemic, and the results show significant improvement. Additionally, the women supported by the CHW have substantially improved pregnancy registration, first ANC, Tetanus injection, consumption of Iron Folic Acid, Calcium and deworming tablets than those who did not. Propesnsity Score Matching analysis shows that the average treatment effect on the various ANC services of having the support of CHW is significant. CONCLUSION(S): This study shows the vital role of CHWs in utilising various Maternal and Child Health services. Better linkage and networking of the CHWs with the community will ensure health service delivery regularly and in an emergency like a pandemic and develop resilience.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - Issues: Social stigma, Fatigue, sexual dysfunction, Sleeplessness, depression commonly seen in Parkinson's patients. Palliative inaccessible in rural/tribal areas. Hence our NGO nurses took initiatives to help alleviate suffering of women with Parkinson patients since October 2018. Objective(s): n=110. Of these statistically over 90% express sexualdysfunction, 68% experience loneliness; 70% suffer social neglect/humiliation, 64% had depression. Importance of spirituality/religion in coping with terminal-illness is increasingly recognized Hence Our NGO-nurses involved community-leaders to make more women involved in our spiritual healing sessions. Method(s): We surveyed 110 subjects through QOL-questionnaires. After 22 weeks therapy with psychosocial support. Counseling & palliative care with anti-depressants/pain-killers/nutrition, QOL improved to statistically significant level. Requirement of palliative care evaluated by Palliative Care Problem Severity Scale (PCPSS). Traditional faith-healers involved for more psychological impact on patients community. Community leaders involved to reduce social stigma/discrimination among community. Result(s): currently 210 specialist palliative care beds required for our Rural/tribal population of 16,00,000. But only 80 available. 60% expressed that religious/community support/faith was most important factor that helped them to cope with Parkinson's. higher scores of QOL (ANOVA p < 0.001) correlated with lack of sexual dysfunction/pain. Our NGO-initiative suggests that over 70% patients will need well trained specialist for home-based-care. Conclusion(s): Life-span/QOL of Parkinson patients-sufferers depends on social acceptance & appropriate-palliative-care. NGOpersonals should be trained in Palliative-care-services. Field of Spiritual/psycho-social/community support is fertile ground for further investigations. We need focused platform like world Parkinson coalition to discuss our project ideas/concerns/difficulties with senior researchers.

N2  - Background: Living with Parkinson's disease (PD) involves living with a variety of symptoms, each of which affects many aspects of everyday life and quality of life (QoL). To support People with PD (PwP) and their caregivers to develop skills and provide them with tools to adapt to life with PD, increase QoL, as well as promote selfmanagement, there is a need for education in all aspects of PD, including psycho-social aspects. Objective(s): The overall purpose of this study is to develop, test and evaluate the results of a self-management program targeted PwP in empowering both PwP and caregivers. Method(s): 85 PD-patients (Hoehn&Yahr score 1-3), and their caregivers will be included in the study. Participants are recruited consecutively from Movement disorder Clinics at two hospitals, neurologists in municipalities and a Rehabilitation Center. The study is divided into three phases: Study 1: Exploratory, qualitative study. Data on how PD-patients describe the needs in everyday life, self-efficacy, coping strategies, and ability to manage symptoms/challenges, and clinical perspectives, was obtained through workshops and focus-group interviews with PwP, caregivers, healthcare professionals and other stakeholders (13 participants in total) Study 2: Intervention study. Based on the results in Study 1, an 8- week self-management program were developed. This consists of 6 educational sessions, monitoring of motor and non-motor symptoms by the Parkinson KinetiGraphTM (PKG At Home), individual goalsetting, home visits by PD-nurse and mindfulness-sessions. Primary oucomes are changes in scores of Health Education Impact Questionnaire (HeiQ) and Health Literacy Scale (HLS-14). Secondary outcome measures are changes in QoL-score (PDQ-39), The General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES), Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale Part-II (UPDRS-II), algorithm outcomes regarding motor symptoms and fluctuation score measured by the PKG, and numbers of contacts to the clinics (evaluated 6 Months before and after the intervention). Study 3: Follow-up study 3 and 6 Months after the intervention. Result(s): Study 1 was completed in September 2022. From October to December 2022 the first group of PwP and their caregivers completed the self-management program (11 PwP and 9 caregivers) in Study 2. Conclusion(s): The results of Study 2 and 3 will be analyzed when all 85 PwP have completed the self-management program.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Background: Concerns about sexual and intimate life are common among people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). Motor as well as nonmotor symptoms negatively affect sexual function, impair intimate relations, and significantly decrease life satisfaction. These concerns are rarely discussed by health care professionals. It is important to emphasize that beside the erotic activities, sexuality has non-erotic aspects (e.g., being close emotionally, hugging and touching), which may boost self-esteem, reduce stress and increase wellbeing of PwPD and their partners. PwPD who belong to the LGBTQ community may have problems and concerns as all PwPD, but they certainly have specific challenges in their intimate and sexual life, an issue which have not been studied. Objective(s): (1) To understand the specific concerns of LGBTQ PwPD regarding their sexual function and intimate relations. (2) To study how various motor and nonmotor symptoms impact these life aspects. (3) To learn what changes have been imposed on the sexual and intimate life since the diagnosis of PD. (4) To propose an intervention strategy appropriate for LGBTQ individuals and couples who cope with PD. Method(s): We plan a pilot study by interviewing 10-15 LGBTQ PwPD. Interviews will consist structured and open questions and will be performed by a sex therapist with >25 years of working with PwPD, and extensive experience in sex therapy with LGBTQ individuals and couples (without PD). Mixed quantitative and qualitive analysis methods will be used. Result(s): Analysis of the interviews' responses will highlight the most bothering sexual concerns of PwPD of the LGBTQ community. Based on this information we plan to create a personalized intervention program for this community. Furthermore, the data will expand our understanding on the effects of motor and nonmotor symptoms on sexual and intimate life of LGBTQ individuals. Conclusion(s): This pilot study focusing on this understudied and under-spoken issue, will enrich us with important information regarding the quality of life of PwPD who belong to the LGBTQ community, which could be used for further inquiries, resulting in intervention programs to improve life satisfaction among individuals and couples of this population.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Background: Difficulties in intimate and sexual life are well-known non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Motor symptoms have also a significant negative effect. Despite their devastating impact on life satisfaction and quality of life, sexual problems and intimate issues are frequently ignored in clinical encounters between Health Care Providers (HCP) and people who live with PD. Our previous studies found that most patients experience such problems, and more than half are motivated to receive appropriate information regarding intimacy and sexuality from their HCP. Delivery of this sensitive information may well reduce stress and increase happiness among individuals and couples who live with PD. Objective(s): To present contemporary and practical intervention program, which could benefit patients and their partners to ameliorate their intimate relations and better cope with these problems. Method(s): Based on our significant clinical experience and research data, we propose practical guidelines to assist HCP in the management of sexual and intimate problems in PD, as well as enable patients and their partners become more educated and proactive in this field. Result(s): A flowchart algorithm is proposed including: 1. Classification of sexual dysfunction related to motor symptoms (e.g. tremor, hypokinesia, bradykinesia, dyskinesia), non-motor symptoms (e.g. depression, apathy, attention deficit, fatigue, urinary incontinence or pain) and medications' effects. 2. Description of intimate and sexual relations disturbed by motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms, and by partners' burden or burn-out. 3. Presentation of treatment and interventional options. Conclusion(s): The proposed guidelines will hopefully promote HCPpatient communication regarding sexual and intimate disturbances in PD and enable improvement of life satisfaction among individuals and couple who live with PD.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of a nurse-led survivorship care program (SCP) on emotional distress, social support, physical health, mental health, and resilience in primary caregivers of patients with advanced head and neck cancer. DATA SOURCES: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. One hundred patient-primary caregiver dyads were randomized into the nurse-led SCP group (experimental) or the usual care group (control). Participants completed a self-reported questionnaire, including measures of emotional distress, social support, physical health, mental health, and resilience. After 6 months, the experimental group reported a significant improvement in emotional distress, social support, physical health, mental health, and resilience. Compared with the control group, measures of emotional distress, physical health, overall resilience, and the resilience aspects of equanimity and perseverance improved in the experimental group. CONCLUSION(S): An SCP may feasibly help alleviate emotional distress, improve social support, increase physical and mental health, and strengthen resilience in the primary caregivers of patients with head and neck cancer. Health care providers should encourage primary caregivers to join an SCP. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The nurse-led SCP can be applied before patients complete treatment, which may increase the positive effect on physical health and adaptation.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in veterans, and trauma-focused evidence-based psychotherapies (TF-EBP) have the strongest evidence for reducing PTSD and improving functioning. However, most veterans with PTSD do not receive TF-EBP. Extensive research focuses on why this gap between scientific recommendations and clinician practice exists. This study adds an unique perspective by reporting on a program evaluation that was jointly designed and implemented by Veterans Affairs researchers and PTSD Clinic providers to increase shared understanding about patterns and predictors of TF-EBP and non-TF-EBP use and interpret results in light of clinic contextual factors. The evaluation describes the psychotherapy utilization patterns of 242 veterans' who were referred to the PTSD clinic and investigates what patient characteristics predict psychotherapy use over the next year. Most veterans (87%) received psychotherapy: 27% received at least one session of TF-EBP and 14% received an adequate dose of TF-EBP. Veterans who started TF-EBP were significantly more likely to receive eight sessions compared to veterans getting non-TF-EBP. Core PTSD symptoms predicted more psychotherapy use, while negative beliefs about oneself/the world predicted less psychotherapy use. Clinicians were more likely to recommend TF-EBP when veterans endorsed feeling guilt/shame in reaction to their emotions. Referral from integrated primary care-mental health providers rather than specialty mental health providers predicted more overall psychotherapy sessions. Clinicians interpret results in line with contextual factors that promote delivery of non-TF-EBP. More clinician engagement in the research process can improve the clinical relevance of research and help bridge the gap between scientific and practice.

N2  - Objectives: This study evaluated the impact of a short-term psychosocial intervention on health-related quality of life among persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis. Method(s): Participants were patients attending three-times weekly haemodialysis session at dialysis units under the preview of two RHA hospitals. The study was conducted during the period February - March 2019. Following informed consent participants were recruited to participate in the study. Sixty-eight participants (Intervention group (IVG)=33; Non-Intervention (NIVG)=36) were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to an IVG or NIVG group. They completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic, anxiety, depression and coping questions. The questionnaire was administered on two occasions at baseline and 6-weeks later. In addition, to regular care participants within the IVG group received three 30-minute counselling sessions weekly with a trained counsellor for 8-weeks. The study was approved by The University of the West Indies Ethics Committee. Result(s): There were no statistically significant mean differences in age, gender, ethnicity, height, weight, body mass index and diabetes variables between IVG and NIVG groups. There was a significant change in the depression and anxiety scores of IVG participants at follow-up compared to baseline (p<0.001). But not hospital anxiety scores. Among coping scores there were significant improvements among IVG participants at follow-up compared to baseline (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Findings from this study suggest the need for interventions aimed at improving coping strategies among persons with ESRD. This might be achieved by using mental health professionals as part of the management of persons with ESRD, especially newly diagnosed ESRD cases.

N2  - Background and aims: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was associated with marked decreases in access to lab based blood borne pathogen testing, including HCV molecular diagnostics. While new diagnoses may have decreased, it was unclear if all other parts of the HCV care cascade engagement would also decrease during each year of the pandemic. Our goal was to describe engagement in care across the care cascade before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a statewide coordinated virtual HCV care program. Method(s): Nova Scotia is a Canadian province with approximately 1,000,000 population. From 2017 to 2022, the majority of HCV care was initiated through in a province wide program which converted to a fully virtual, nurse delegated program in July 2020 with the advent of the pandemic. We measured the number of referrals, care engagements, treatment starts, documented SVRs (sustained virologic responses), and treatment failures annually from 2019 (considered pre-pandemic) until December 2022. Result(s): HCV program referrals decreased approximately 30% in 2020/21 (187,183) compared to 2019 (264) and 2022 (220). However, initial virtual visits to establish care were stable across 2019 (69), 2020 (85), and 2021 (67), and increase to 114 in 2022. 158 people initiated treatment in 2019, compared with 135 in 2020, 115 in 2021 and 93 in 2022. SVR was status was known in 111 people in 2019, compared to 104 people in 2020, 75 in 2021, and 21 in 2022. Treatment failure or reinfection was stable over all years. Conclusion(s): New HCV infection estimation was limited during the pandemic, given the lack of point of care and lab-based HCV testing in the province. However, conversion to a virtual platform, centralized referral and treatment, as well as expert delegated nurse role was associated with equivalent engagement in care but slightly decreased treatment initiation. Building HCV care resilience through virtual and delegated collaborative prescriber programs should be considered in future pandemic preparedness planning and blood borne pathogen management.Copyright © 2023 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

N2  - Background: An action-oriented approach such as acceptance and commitment therapy may help reduce the fusion of conflicting ideas, empower new intern nurses to act according to their values, and maximize their psychological flexibility. Objective(s): To evaluate the impact of a virtual group-based acceptance and commitment therapy intervention on intern nurses' social adjustment and work-family conflict. Design(s): A parallel, single-blind randomized control trial on intern nurses (n = 70) was randomly allocated to either a six-session online acceptance or commitment therapy intervention (n = 35) or a waiting list control group (n = 35), with each session lasting 90 min. Measures: The work-related acceptance and action questionnaire, the social adjustment scale-self report, and the work-family conflict scale before, after, and one month after the intervention. Result(s): The psychological flexibility mean score of the study group was significantly higher than that of the control group (43.11 vs. 34.15, p <.001) immediately after the intervention, and this effect was sustained one month after the intervention (41.88 vs. 33.21, p <.001) with a more significant effect size (F = 128.457, p <.001, eta2 = 0.791). The social adjustment mean score of the study group had significantly improved in all four subscales, with statistically significant differences (p <.001). One month after the intervention, the study group had significantly higher scores than the control group in total score, with statistically significant differences (p <.001) and large effect sizes (eta2 = 0.932). Work-family conflict mean score of the study group was decreased immediately after the intervention, with statistically significant differences (p <.001). One month after the intervention, the study group had significantly lower scores than the control group in all three subscales of the WFCS, with statistically significant differences (p <.001) and large effect sizes (eta2 = 0.943). Conclusion(s): Our findings proved that the virtual group-based ACT intervention effectively improved psychological flexibility and social adjustment, reducing work-family conflict among intern nurses. These findings suggest that the virtual group-based ACT intervention can be a practical approach to improving intern nurses' mental health and well-being, which could affect their job performance and overall quality of life. Trial registration: The study was registered retrospectively as a randomized clinical trial on 10/2/2023, reference number; NCT05721339 .Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Understanding related risk factors of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) could avoid treatment failure and provide an insight of personalized treatment approach among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with self-reported treatment qualities and domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among PLWH in Uganda. Method(s): Data were from "Life on antiretroviral therapy: People's adaptive coping and adjustment to living with HIV as a chronic condition in Wakiso District, Uganda" in English. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to assess the HRQoL of 263 PLWH in the sample. Considering variance inflation factors, multiple regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between demographic factors, ART obtainment, treatment burden, and self-reported treatment qualities, associations between demographic factors, self-reported treatment qualities, and HRQoL, and association between ART obtainment and HRQoL. Controlling for the confounding effects, several regression anatomies were employed to explore the associations between self-reported treatment qualities and six domains of HRQoL. Result(s): In the sample, the geographical distribution were urban (5.70%), semi-urban (37.26%), and rural (57.03%). 67.30% of the participants were females. The mean age of the sample was 39.82 years (standard deviation = 9.76) ranging from 22 to 81 years. Multiple logistic regressions reported statistically significant associations of distance to ART facility with self-reported quality of services, advice, manners, and counseling, statistically significant association between self-reported manners quality and four domains of HRQoL, and statistically significant association between TASO membership and domains of HRQoL. Plots from regression anatomies reported that self-reported treatment qualities had statistically significant associations with six domains of HRQoL. Conclusion(s): Treatment burden, self-reported treatment qualities, ART obtainment, and TASO were possible determinants of individual domains of HRQoL among PLWH in Uganda. PLWH's HRQoL might be improved by promoting medical quality and optimizing ART obtainment in the healthcare providers' practice. Findings in this study had important implications for the redesign of clinical guidelines, healthcare delivery, and health care co-ordination among PLWH globally.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: Studies have suggested a potential link between traumatic experiences, psychological stress, and autoimmunity, but the impact of stress on disease activity and symptom severity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains unclear. The present study was undertaken to examine whether increases in perceived stress independently associate with worse SLE disease outcomes over 3 years of follow-up. Method(s): Participants were drawn from the California Lupus Epidemiology Study (CLUES). Stress was measured annually using the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Participants with increases of >=0.5 SD in PSS score were defined as having an increase in stress. Four outcomes were measured at the year 3 follow-up visit: physician-assessed disease activity (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index); patient-reported disease activity (Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire); pain (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] pain interference scale); and fatigue (PROMIS fatigue scale). Multivariable linear regression evaluated longitudinal associations of increase in stress with all 4 outcomes while controlling for potential confounders. Result(s): The sample (n = 260) was 91% female, 36% Asian, 30% White, 22% Hispanic, and 11% African American; the mean +/- SD age was 46 +/- 14 years. In adjusted longitudinal analyses, increase in stress was independently associated with greater physician-assessed disease activity (P = 0.015), greater self-reported disease activity (P < 0.001), more pain (P = 0.019), and more fatigue (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): In a racially diverse sample of individuals with SLE, those who experienced an increase in stress had significantly worse disease activity and greater symptom burden at follow-up compared to those with stress levels that remained stable or declined. Findings underscore the need for interventions to bolster stress resilience and support effective coping strategies among individuals living with lupus.Copyright © 2022 American College of Rheumatology.

N2  - Pregnancy and childbirth represent a sequence of challenging events, and adaptive coping strategies are necessary to maintain emotional wellbeing. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of applying a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) for pregnant Saudi women with anxiety in the third trimester. A quasi-experimental, within- and between-subject design was used for this study. Data were collected at two points between February and August 2021 from 88 participants using the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. A large, statistically significant reduction was observed in the mean scores of participants' anxiety post-intervention. Furthermore, the anxiety level in the intervention group was very low post-intervention compared to that in the control group. Level of education and spontaneous or medically necessary abortion significantly influenced participants' anxiety. The MBI sessions helped nulliparous women experience less anxiety during pregnancy. Healthcare providers' awareness about the importance of incorporating mindfulness in childbirth education should be increased. Future research should examine the long-term effects of mindfulness-based techniques on maternal health.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Firefighters represent an understudied population with high rates of chronic exposure to stress and potentially traumatic events. Thus, there is a need to identify modifiable resilience factors to address posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PTSD) and chronic pain in firefighters to inform prevention and intervention efforts. METHOD(S): The current sample included 155 firefighters (93.5% male; Mage =42.2, SD=9.8) recruited online from career, volunteer, and combination (i.e., volunteer and career) departments in a large metropolitan area in the southern United States. RESULT(S): Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the associations between/among resilience and hope on PTSD symptoms, chronic pain, well-being, and posttraumatic growth (PTG). Resilience had a stronger, negative relationship with PTSD and chronic pain compared to hope, while hope had a stronger, positive relationship with PTG and well-being compared to resilience. Hope and resilience combined predicted 10%-33% of the variance in the outcomes. CONCLUSION(S): The current findings may provide evidence to promote interventions that increase resilience and hope in firefighters.Copyright © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - PURPOSE: This research was carried out to determine the effects of the personality traits of surgical nurses on COVID-19 fear, work stress, and psychological resilience in the pandemic. DESIGN: The research was descriptive and cross-sectional types. METHOD(S): The study was conducted between February 2021 and May 2021 at a State University Research Hospital. The research aimed to reach all surgery nurses (357) working in surgical units without selecting a sample. The sample included 325 participants. At the end of the study, the participation rate was 91.03%. Study reporting adheres to STROBE checklist. FINDINGS: It was determined that 43.4% of the nurses participating in the study were in the age range of 26-30, 64.9% were women. The correlation values between the COVID-19 Fear Scale and the Nurse Stress Scale scores were found to be significant in the positive direction. The correlation values between the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire neuroticism subdimension and the Nurse Stress Scale, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale scores were found to be positive. CONCLUSION(S): During the pandemic, it is suggested that nurses' work stress and psychological resilience levels should be evaluated at regular intervals and that in-service trainings on coping with stress and stress management should be organized. Taking the necessary precautions and improving working conditions will have positive effects on both the health of nurses and patient care.Copyright © 2022 American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses.

N2  - Objectives Physicians and medical students are subject to higher levels of psychological distress than the general population. These challenges have a negative impact in medical practice, leading to uncompassionate care. This pilot study aims to examine the feasibility of Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT) to reduce psychological distress and improve the well-being of medical students. We hypothesize that the CCT program, as compared to a waitlist control group, will reduce psychological distress (i.e., stress, anxiety, and depression) and burnout symptoms, while improving compassion, empathy, mindfulness, resilience, psychological well-being, and emotion-regulation strategies after the intervention. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these improvements will be maintained at a two-month follow-up. Methods Medical students were randomly assigned to an 8-week CCT or a Waitlist control group (WL). They completed self-report assessments at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and a 2-month follow-up. The outcomes measured were compassion, empathy, mindfulness, well-being, resilience, emotional regulation, psychological distress, burnout, and COVID-19 concern. Mixed-effects models and Reliable Change Index were computed. Results Compared with WL, CCT showed significant improvements in self-compassion, mindfulness, and emotion regulation, as well as a significant decrease in stress, anxiety, and emotional exhaustion component of burnout. Furthermore, some of these effects persisted at follow-up. No adverse effects of meditation practices were found. Conclusions CCT enhanced compassion skills while reducing psychological distress in medical students, this being critical to preserving the mental health of physicians while promoting compassionate care for patients. The need for institutions to include this type of training is also discussed.Copyright © 2023 Rojas et al.

N2  - Background: Young-onset dementia (YOD) describes a group of neurodegenerative conditions occurring before the age of 65, often caused by dominant genes such as C9ORF72, PSEN1 and MAPT. The social context of YOD creates extra psychological and social challenges, yet the experiences of at-risk relatives are often overlooked in society and healthcare settings. A deeper understanding is necessary for effective genetic counseling about YOD. Aim(s): To identify the psychological and social impacts on asymptomatic relatives in families with YOD. Method(s): A systematic review of key databases for empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals relating to the lived experience of individuals at genetic risk for YOD was performed. Data was collated and interpreted via a narrative synthesis. Result(s): Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were qualitative and explored the experiences of children with a parent with YOD. Five themes were developed: (1) Onset of YOD disrupts family functioning (2) Emotional impact is significant and varied (3) Uncertain Future (4) Lack of visibility in health care and society (5) coping strategies include emotion-focused coping and distancing. Conclusion(s): Health professionals can explore the psychosocial needs of YOD for relatives and facilitate referrals and support to mitigate the effects of belonging to a family where YOD is present. We present a practical framework of questions and strategies for care of relatives, mapped to the self-regulation model of genetic counseling.

N2  - Introduction: The challenges faced by healthcare workers, not least during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have been extensively studied, and concerns continue to be highlighted in relation to their long-term mental health. Identifying the need to support their personnel, a leader-led structured programme of reflection: the recovery, readjustment and reintegration programme (R3P) was designed by the UK Defence Medical Services to mitigate the potential stressors associated with this outbreak and enhance the resilience of the workforce. Method(s): 128 military personnel completed an evaluation of R3P. A survey included measures of anxiety before and after the intervention, perceptions of the discussion themes and whether these brought a sense of closure to areas of distress, and attitudes to help-seeking. Result(s): Most respondents (86%-92%) rated the five discussion themes either a  helpful' or a  very helpful', 51% of respondents reported a sense of closure about an issue that had been causing distress and 72% of respondents felt better able to seek help should it be necessary. Evaluating the effect R3P had on anxiety, a Wilcoxon signed rank test elicited a statistically significant difference in anxiety pre-R3P and post-R3P; Z=-3.54, p<0.001. The median anxiety rating was 3.5 (IQR 4.75, 95% CI 1.25 to 6.00) before undertaking R3P, which decreased to 3 (IQR 4.75, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.75) after undertaking R3P. 39.1% of participants reported decreased anxiety, 18.8% reported increased anxiety and 42.2% reported no change. Conclusion(s): This evaluation has identified several positive aspects to R3P with many personnel reporting a reduction in anxiety, a sense of closure and increased likelihood of help-seeking. Several participants did report an increase in anxiety and the long-term impact of R3P on mental health and well-being is unclear. Further mixed-methods evaluation incorporating a longer follow-up is required. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Some cancer patients experience cancer-related cognitive change (CRCC). Cognitive rehabilitation interventions (CRIs) have recently been developed to help mitigate the impact of CRCC, which, untreated, can impact resumption of daily life post-cancer treatment. The experience of participants is important to understand but largely absent within research literature. This study aimed to explore how those with CRCC experience the phenomenon following completion of a CRI. METHOD(S): This study comprised a qualitative phenomenological approach. This involved conducting in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 6 self-referred participants from one CRI. Participants were invited to discuss their experience of CRCC and what the CRI therefore meant to them. Interviews were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. RESULT(S): Analysis of the findings revealed 4 key themes. (1) "Experiencing and addressing isolation" comprises reflections on posttreatment perceived abandonment and consequent feelings of belonging through CRI participation. (2) "Identity" explores participants' reflections around perceived loss-of-self and feelings of empowerment from the intervention. (3) "Cognitive and physical balance" comprises the planning and choices participants make, supported by both their own and CRI coping strategies as they seek acceptance of cognitive change. (4) "Course reflections" explore reflections on intervention structure, format, and delivery, focusing on 2 subthemes of accessibility, flexibility and inclusivity, and communication. All participants reflected positively on their experience. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Results support further dissemination among health professionals and implementation of this CRI to better support self-reported CRCC concerns within this population. Future qualitative research should explore the long-term impact of CRI interventions.

N2  - Little is known about the positive psychological changes or posttraumatic growth (PTG) in response to the pandemic as the COVID-19 vaccines has become widely available. This longitudinal study aimed to characterize changes in the prevalence of pandemic-related PTG, and to identify and quantify the relative importance of PTG correlates pre-pandemic, 1- year peri-pandemic, and 2-years post-pandemic onset. A total of 2,441 U.S. military veterans completed Wave 3 assessment of the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study. In the full sample, a significant decrease from peri-pandemic to 2-years post-pandemic onset was observed in overall pandemic-related PTG (41.5% to 32.2%) and four domains of PTG (appreciation of life, relating to others, personal strength, spiritual changes). Among veterans who screened positive for pandemic-related posttraumatic stress symptoms, the prevalence of pandemic-related PTG was markedly higher and did not change from peri-pandemic to 2-years post-pandemic onset (78.4% to 73.4%). Greater pre-pandemic PTG (personal strength and new possibilities) and greater worries about the effect of pandemic on one's mental health were the strongest correlates of pandemic-related PTG 2-years post-pandemic onset. Results suggest that psychosocial interventions to bolster PTG in relation to early life traumas may help facilitate PTG in response to the pandemic and related crises.Copyright © 2023

N2  - BACKGROUND: Occupational stress is generally acknowledged as a major issue in the health sector that may have a detrimental impact on nurses' psychological and physical health, particularly during the COVID-19 epidemic. AIM: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a psychoeducational interventional programme in decreasing occupational stress and improving coping methods among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): This study used a cluster-randomized approach. Data were collected from 80 nurses working in two public health-care centres from May to August 2020 in Jordan. Two centres were assigned randomly to the intervention and control groups. The psychoeducational programme was delivered to the intervention group in six sessions over 6days for 2weeks. The collected data were analysed using SPSS through descriptive and inferential statistics. Occupational stress and coping strategies were measured. RESULT(S): Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the degrees of occupational stress and coping strategies significantly differed between study groups over the three points of data collection. CONCLUSION(S): This psychoeducational interventional programme is a valuable noninvasive method that can improve individual coping strategies to manage stress in practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

N2  - Aims: To explore the care needs to integrate mHealth technology to promote diabetes self-management engagement from the perspectives of patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Design(s): A phenomenological study using individual, semi-structured, face-to-face-based interviews. Method(s): Purposive sampling of 15 patients with poorly controlled T2DM were recruited from a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted to gain in-depth insight into the care needs regarding mHealth perceived by patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using the thematic analysis approach. Result(s): Four themes and fourteen subthemes emerged from the interview data: (1) informational needs (subthemes: symptoms management, self-care monitoring, complication prevention, and public awareness), (2) emotional needs (subthemes: psychological flexibility and health coping), (3) functional needs of mHealth services (subthemes: continuity of care, personalized coaching, family participation), (4) technical needs related to online applications (subthemes: accessibility, convenience, efficiency, usability, and trustworthy) Conclusion(s): This study shed light on the complex and changeable needs of patients with poorly controlled T2DM due to complications and comorbidities. Healthcare providers could incorporate the identified needs in the development of mHealth-based interventions to optimize the health outcomes of patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. Keywords: poor glycemic control; type 2 diabetes mellitus; health needs; mHealth diabetes services.

N2  - The article aims to understand the psychosocial impacts experienced by health workers after a disaster situation in the state of Santa Catarina in Southern region of Brazil. To that end, a qualitative study of multiple cases and narrative interviews with professionals from mental health services, primary health care, and municipal managers in Itajai, Blumenau, and Rio do Sul was carried out. The analysis of the narratives followed the steps of the Fritz Schutze method. The psychosocial impacts on the health and work of respondents, directly and/or indirectly affected by the natural disaster that happened in 2008 in the region, and subsequent events of lesser intensity, were described. In the three cases the impacts were perceived similarly, although the consequences of the event in the municipal network were faced differently in each location. The results reveal the importance of promoting health at work and developing personal skills, resilience in the face of adverse situations, and need for continuing and constant education.Copyright © 2023, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

N2  - Background: The United States is mired in two intertwined epidemics of death from suicide and overdose. Opioid use disorder (OUD) and mental illness contribute to both, and individuals with co-occurring disorders (CODs) are a complex population at high risk. Although universal prevention makes sense from a public health perspective, medical and behavioral health providers often lack the time to proactively address these issues with all patients. In this study, we build upon a parent study called Collaboration Leading to Addiction Treatment and Recovery from Other Stresses (CLARO), a model of collaborative care in which care coordinators deliver preventative measures to high-risk patients and coordinate care with the patients' care team, with the goal of increasing MOUD retention and decreasing risk of suicide and overdose. Method(s): CLARO+ adds intervention components on overdose prevention, recognition, and response training; lethal means safety counseling; and an effort to mail compassionate messages called Caring Contacts. Both CLARO and CLARO+ have been implemented at 17 clinics in New Mexico and California, and this study seeks to determine the difference in effectiveness between the two versions of the intervention. This paper describes the design protocol for CLARO+. Conclusion(s): CLARO+ is an innovative approach that aims to supplement existing collaborative care with additional suicide and overdose prevention strategies.

N2  - Background/Objective: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) PRIDE in All Who Served health education group (PRIDE) was developed to improve health equity and access to care for military veterans who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and/or other sexual/gender-diverse identities (LGBTQ+). This 10-week program rapidly spread to over 30 VHA facilities in 4 years. Veterans receiving PRIDE experience improved LGBTQ+ identity-related resilience and reductions in suicide attempt likelihood. Despite PRIDE's rapid spread across facilities, information is lacking on implementation determinants. The current study's goal was to clarify determinants of PRIDE group implementation and sustainment. Method(s): A purposive sample of VHA staff (N = 19) with experience delivering or implementing PRIDE completed teleconference interviews January-April 2021. The interview guide was informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Rapid qualitative matrix analysis was completed with methods to ensure rigor (e.g., triangulation and investigator reflexivity). Result(s): Key barriers and facilitators of PRIDE implementation were heavily related to facility inner setting (what is happening inside the facility), including implementation readiness (e.g., leadership support for LGBTQ+-affirming programming, access to LGBTQ+-affirming care training) and facility culture (e.g., systemic anti-LGBTQ+ stigma). Several implementation process facilitators enhanced engagement at sites, such as a centrally facilitated PRIDE learning collaborative and a formal process of contracting/training for new PRIDE sites. Discussion/Conclusion: Although aspects of the outer setting and larger societal influences were mentioned, the majority of factors impacting implementation success were at the VHA facility level and therefore may be more readily addressable through tailored implementation support. The importance of LGBTQ+ equity at the facility level indicates that implementation facilitation should ideally address institutional equity in addition to implementation logistics. Combining effective interventions with attention to local implementation needs will be required before LGBTQ+ veterans in all areas will benefit from PRIDE and other health equity-focused interventions.Copyright © 2023, The author(s).

N2  - Background: The importance of self-care for patients living with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is well-known. However, this can be challenging for immigrants given the need to navigate a new culture and health care system, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to understand how COVID-19 impacts self-care behaviours of first-generation Chinese Australians living with CVD. Method(s): A qualitative descriptive design was employed. Individual semi-structured phone interviews were conducted among Chinese Australians living with CVD, recruited via Chinese Community Centres and social media from September 2021 to May 2022. Data analysis was performed through deductive and inductive thematic analysis, guided by the Middle-Range Theory of Self-Care of Chronic Illness. Result(s): Eighteen participants with mean age 68 years shared their self-care experiences related to COVID-19, predominantly involving exercise limitation, barriers to access medical care and increased stress from social isolation. Regarding the self-care monitoring and management, some participants reported their weight gain, self-adjusted their medication without physician consultation, and delayed seeking emergency services when angina occurred. While some participants adapted well to the COVID-19 restriction measures with coping skills, such as keeping social distance, changing exercise modes and stocking sufficient medications. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 negatively impacted the self-care behaviours of Chinese Australians, disruptions dominantly in exercise routine, access to medical care and social isolation. These findings implicate the vulnerabilities in maintaining self-care among Chinese Australians. Health education on how to self-care CVD for Chinese Australians is urgently needed.Copyright © 2023

N2  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has imposed unprecedented pressure on health systems and has interrupted public health efforts for other major health conditions, including HIV. It is critical to comprehensively understand how the pandemic has affected the delivery and utilization of HIV-related services and what are the effective strategies that may mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 and resultant interruptions. The current study thus aims to comprehensively investigate HIV service interruptions during the pandemic following a socioecological model, to assess their impacts on various outcomes of the HIV prevention and treatment cascade and to identify resilience resources for buffering impacts of interruptions on HIV treatment cascade outcomes. We will assess HIV service interruptions in South Carolina (SC) since 2020 using operational report data from Ryan White HIV clinics and HIV service utilization data (including telehealth use) based on statewide electronic health records (EHR) and cellphone-based place visitation data. We will further explore how HIV service interruptions affect HIV prevention and treatment cascade outcomes at appropriate geospatial units based on the integration of multi-type, multi-source datasets (e.g., EHR, geospatial data). Finally, we will identify institutional-, community-, and structural-level factors (e.g., resilience resources) that may mitigate the adverse impacts of HIV service interruptions based on the triangulation of quantitative (i.e., EHR data, geospatial data, online survey data) and qualitative (i.e., in-depth interviews with clinic leaders, healthcare providers, people living with HIV, and HIV clinic operational reports) data regarding health system infrastructure, social capital, and organizational preparedness. Our proposed research can lead to a better understanding of complicated HIV service interruptions in SC and resilience factors that can mitigate the negative effects of such interruptions on various HIV treatment cascade outcomes. The multilevel resilience resources identified through data triangulation will assist SC health departments and communities in developing strategic plans in response to this evolving pandemic and other future public health emergencies (e.g., monkeypox, disasters caused by climate change). The research findings can also inform public health policymaking and the practices of other Deep South states with similar sociocultural contexts in developing resilient healthcare systems and communities and advancing epidemic preparedness.Copyright © 2023.
